Separate the doses of PCV13 and PPSV23 in immunocompetent persons with underlying chronic conditions (eg, chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, cigarette smoking) as follows: ages 24 months to 71 months (8 weeks at minimum), ages 65 years or greater (1 year at minimum). Separate the doses of PCV13 and PPSV23 in persons with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, or cochlear implants as follows: ages 24 months or greater (8 weeks at minimum). <br><br>If PPSV23 is inadvertently administered before PCV13, separate the doses in immunocompetent persons with underlying chronic conditions as follows: ages 24 months to 71 months (8 weeks at minimum), ages 65 years or greater (1 year at minimum). Separate the vaccines in persons with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, CSF leaks, or cochlear implants as follows: ages 24 months to 18 years (8 weeks at minimum), ages 19 years or greater (1 year at minimum).<br><br>Regardless of vaccine sequence, separate the vaccines by 1 year at minimum in persons age 65 years or greater with no underlying condition. The vaccine series is not recommended in persons with no underlying conditions who are younger than 65 years or in immunocompetent persons 6 to 64 years of age with underlying chronic conditions.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> Several studies have demonstrated an improved immune response against serotypes common to both the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13 Valent) (PCV13) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23 Valent) (PPSV23) when the PCV13 vaccine was administered first.<sup>1,2,3,4</sup> <br><br>Studies have also shown a better antibody response when PCV13 and PPSV23 are administered at intervals greater than 1 year.<sup>1,2,5</sup> Further, vaccine intervals shorter than 8 weeks are not recommended due to the potential for increased local injection-site reactions compared with longer intervals.<sup>1,6</sup> <br><br>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a subcommittee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), currently recommends that a dose of PCV13 be followed by a dose of PPSV23 in all adults aged 65 years or greater who have not previously received pneumococcal vaccine and in persons aged 2 years or greater who are at high risk for pneumococcal disease because of underlying medical conditions.<sup>1</sup> There are no available studies evaluating the efficacy of the vaccines administered in series; therefore, current recommendations are based on the best available evidence from immunogenicity studies.<br><br>The mechanism for the improved immune response seen with the PCV-PPSV23 sequence and longer dosing interval between vaccines is not fully understood, but may involve improved immunological memory when conjugated vaccines are followed by free polysaccharide vaccines.<sup>2,7</sup></p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.

The mean weekly dose increased from 4,400 units at baseline to 8,600 units at 12 months in the ACE inhibitor-treated group vs. 4,600 units at baseline and 4,200 units at 12 months in the control group.<sup>9</sup> Another cross-sectional study reported significantly higher ESA requirements in patients taking both an ESA and an ACE inhibitor vs. those using an ESA alone (56 vs. 36 IU/kg/HD session, respectively).<sup>12</sup> In a large study of type 2 diabetics (n=1,015), ACE inhibitor therapy was associated with ESA resistance in a univariate analysis, though the association was statistically insignificant [OR=1.27 (95% CI: 0.96 to 1.69)].<sup>13</sup> A multivariate analysis revealed a generally similar association with ACE inhibitor therapy [OR=1.32 (95% CI: 0.98 to 1.78)].<br><br>In contrast, other clinical outcome studies (n=12 to n=2,213) have reported minimal or no evidence of ESA resistance with concurrent use of ACE inhibitors and ESAs.<sup>14,15, 16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23</sup><br><br>The mechanism for this potential drug interaction has not been fully investigated. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) appears to be involved in regulation of endogenous erythropoietin production, with activation of RAS leading to enhanced production of endogenous erythropoietin.<sup>22,23</sup>. The full impact of RAS alteration on response to or dose requirements of exogenous ESAs is not fully understood.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1. Schiffl H, Bergner A.

Specifically, this decrease in tacrolimus concentrations may occur with continued prolonged combination therapy. Daclatasvir may increase the serum concentration of Tacrolimus (Systemic). Specifically, this increase in tacrolimus concentrations may occur during the first week of combined therapy. <b>Severity</b> Moderate <b>Reliability Rating</b> Fair </p> \n<p><b>Patient Management</b> Monitor tacrolimus serum concentrations closely if combined with daclatasvir. Tacrolimus concentrations may initially be elevated, but then may decrease significantly. Tacrolimus dose increases may be required.</p> \n<p><b>Discussion</b> In a retrospective study of 6 liver transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus, treatment with daclatasvir (60 mg once daily) and asunaprevir (100 mg twice daily) for 24 weeks reduced tacrolimus serum concentrations 32%, but no tacrolimus dose adjustments were required to maintain therapeutic serum concentrations.<sup>1</sup> In another retrospective analysis of 10 liver transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus, treatment with daclatasvir/asunaprevir initially increased the tacrolimus concentration-to-dose ratio 32% in the first week, but then it decreased 25% from baseline by week 2 and remained decreased throughout daclatasvir therapy.<sup>2</sup> In 2 retrospective studies (N = 164) of kidney transplant patients receiving tacrolimus, treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with a direct-acting antiviral agent (approximately 18% of patients received daclatasvir/sofosbuvir) decreased tacrolimus serum concentrations 21% to 25% over the course of treatment.<sup>3,4</sup> Tacrolimus doses were numerically higher at the end of HCV treatment compared with baseline tacrolimus doses.<sup>3,4</sup> Case reports describe tacrolimus-treated patients who initially had increases in tacrolimus concentrations after initiation of daclatasvir/asunaprevir,<sup>5</sup> but ultimately had significant decreases in tacrolimus serum concentrations (70%)<sup>6,7</sup> and required increases in tacrolimus dose (33% to 50%).<sup>5,6,7</sup><br><br>In contrast, a pharmacokinetic study of healthy volunteers found that daclatasvir (60 mg daily x 8 days) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus (5 mg single dose).<sup>8</sup> Additionally, other case reports describe patients taking tacrolimus who did not have changes in their tacrolimus concentrations with the addition of daclatasvir to their treatment regimens.<sup>7,9,10,11</sup><br><br>The mechanism of this potential interaction has not been fully investigated. Initial increases in tacrolimus concentrations seen in some analyses may be due to daclatasvir/asunaprevir-mediated inhibition of P-glycoprotein, a transporter responsible for tacrolimus disposition. The mechanism behind the reduced tacrolimus exposure seen with continued combination therapy in these studies may not be the result of a true drug interaction, but merely an improvement in liver function and changes in cytokine levels, as a result of treating HCV, leading to increased tacrolimus metabolism.</p> \n<p><b>Footnotes</b> </p>\n<p>1.
