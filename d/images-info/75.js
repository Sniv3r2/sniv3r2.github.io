Once the host mounts an immune response beginning 10 to 14 days after the infection, the viremia resolves and reticulocytes return. Note the biphasic timing of symptoms, during the peak viremia and again after the viremia has cleared.

Curve B (in blue) plots data from a patient who had a history of prior pericarditis, assumed to be of viral etiology. Subsequently he developed a chronic pericardial effusion that reached at least 1500 mL in volume. At the time of presentation to our service, the jugular venous pressure was 22 mmHg. Aspiration of 300 mL of pericardial fluid reduced the pericardial pressure to 10 mmHg, and removing another 600 mL achieved a nearly normal pericardial pressure.

Donor strain genetic material is shown in white and recipient genetic material is shown in black. There are 2 stages in the RC breeding program. The behavior of a schematic autosome pair is depicted during each of these stages. Stage 1 consists of repeated backcrosses to the recipient strain, so as to reduce the donor contribution to the genotype. There is no selection for donor alleles. Stage 2 occurs as independent sib-pairs from the second backcross generation are used to establish new inbred strains, with full-sib matings at each gneration. Inbreeding fixes the genotype of the strain, with most loci becoming homozygous by the 12th generation. The resulting array of genotypes is shown schematically at the bottom of the figure. Only 1 copy of the schematic autosome from each strain in the set is shown. The donor contributions in each strain in the set are map loci contributing to continuously varying traits and eliminates the need for genotyping to achieve the resolution achieved by QTL quantitatively similar, but the specific chromosome regions of donor genotype will differ from one strain to another.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Adapted from: Demant P, Hart AA.

Urea equilibration is so rapid that diffusion begins to level off at 90 to 120 minutes, and is essentially complete at 240 minutes. Thus, short dwell times will maximize the rate of urea removal. In comparison, larger molecules show a progressive decline in the rate of diffusion. Inulin diffusion, for example, increases linearly with time since a limiting concentration gradient is not approached. As a result, increasing the total time of dialysis enhances the rate of clearance of these larger molecules.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Data from Popovich RP, Moncrief JW, Nolph KD, et al.

Abnormal&nbsp;renal function is defined as the presence of chronic dialysis, renal transplantation, or serum creatinine ≥200 micromol/L. Abnormal liver function is defined as chronic hepatic disease (eg, cirrhosis) or biochemical evidence of significant hepatic derangement (eg, bilirubin more than two times the&nbsp;upper limit of normal, plus one or more of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and/or alkaline phosphatase more than three times the upper limit normal). Bleeding predisposition includes chronic bleeding disorder or&nbsp;previous bleeding requiring hospitalization or transfusion.

The normal pacemaker is in the sinoatrial (SA) node at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium (shown in green). The SA node activates the right and left atria. Ventricular activation results from the impulse traversing the atrioventricular&nbsp;(AV) node, the specialized infranodal conducting system (His bundle and bundle and fascicular branches, shown in red), thereby activating the ventricular myocardium (shown in yellow). In addition, however, the presence of an accessory pathway (AP) which conducts in the antegrade direction causes early activation (preexcitation) of a portion of the left ventricle (shown in blue). The degree of preexcitation depends upon the time required to conduct through the right and left atria, the AP, and the ventricular myocardium as compared to conduction through the normal pathways. The inset on the right shows the electrocardiogram (ECG) timing of these events. The net effect is a QRS complex that is a fusion of ventricular preexcitation (blue) and normal excitation (yellow). The combination of preexcitation and normal excitation leads to a short PR interval, a delta wave, and prolongation of the QRS duration. This ECG pattern is referred to as the Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 75296 Version 4.0</div></div></div>"},"75297":{"type":"graphic_diagnosticimage","displayName":"Intussusception Air contrast III","title":"Intussusception","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div style=\"width: 470px\" class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Intussusception</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><img style=\"width:332px; height:432px;\" src=\"images/GAST/75297_Intussusception_Air_III.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"/></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">Air contrast enema after successful reduction of the intussusception: post-evaluation film.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Courtesy of Nancy Fitzgerald, MD and Taylor Chung, MD.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 75297 Version 4.0</div></div></div>"},"75301":{"type":"graphic_figure","displayName":"Loop of Henle transport","title":"Ion transport in loop of Henle","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div style=\"width: 470px\" class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Ion transport in loop of Henle</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><img style=\"width:440px; height:221px;\" src=\"images/NEPH/75301_LoopofHenletransport.gif\" alt=\"Image\"/></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">Schematic representation of the transport mechanisms in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The Na-K-ATPase pump in the basolateral (peritubular) membrane pumps sodium (Na) out of, and potassium (K) into, the cell. This creates a low intracellular Na concentration, which drives many of the cell's reabsorptive processes. The entry of filtered sodium chloride (NaCl) into the cells is mediated by an electroneutral Na-K-2Cl (NKCC2) cotransporter in the apical (luminal) membrane. This is also called the furosemide-sensitive cotransporter. The energy for this process is provided by the favorable inward electrochemical gradient for Na (the intracellular Na concentration is very low, and the cell interior is electronegative). The inward movement of K and Cl occurs against their electrochemical gradients and is powered by the inward movement of Na into the cell. The reabsorbed Na (which has entered the cell) is pumped out by the Na-K-ATPase pump. The concentration of K in the filtrate and tubular fluid is much lower than that of Na and Cl, and much of the reabsorbed K recycles back into the lumen through K channels (ROMK) in the apical membrane to allow continued NaCl reabsorption. This movement of cationic K into the lumen plus the flux of reabsorbed Cl out of the cell and&nbsp;into the peritubular capillary (via Cl channels) causes the lumen to become more positively <FONT color=black>charged compared</FONT> with the cell and peritubular space. This lumen electropositivity creates an electrical gradient that promotes the passive reabsorption of cations—Na, calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg)—via the paracellular pathway between the cells. The most important Cl channels in these cells are ClC-Kb. Also present but not as critical are the ClC-Ka channels. Each of these Cl channels requires interaction with a small protein called barttin to function normally. The single Cl channel shown in the figure represents both intact ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb channels.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 75301 Version 11.0</div></div></div>"},"75302":{"type":"graphic_diagnosticimage","displayName":"PUV VUR urine extravasation","title":"Urine extraction observed in a voiding cystourethrogram in a patient with posterior urethal valves","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div style=\"width: 470px\" class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Urine extraction observed in a voiding cystourethrogram in a patient with posterior urethal valves</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><img style=\"width:327px; height:385px;\" src=\"images/PEDS/75302_PUV_VUR_urine_extravasation.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"/></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">Voiding cystourethrogram of a&nbsp;patient with severe urethral obstruction secondary to posterior urethral valves with&nbsp;high grade vesicoureteral&nbsp;reflux&nbsp;and urinary extravasation from kidney (white arrows).</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Courtesy of Nicholas Holmes, MD.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 75302 Version 3.0</div></div></div>"},"75303":{"type":"graphic_picture","displayName":"Corneal ulcers","title":"Corneal infiltrates or ulcers","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div style=\"width: 470px\" class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Corneal infiltrates or ulcers</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><img style=\"width:393px; height:258px;\" src=\"images/PC/75303_Corneal_ulcers.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"/></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">Two small corneal white spots that are either infiltrates or ulcers (indicated by the arrows) are shown with normal light illumination.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Courtesy of Lawrence B Stack, MD.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 75303 Version 1.0</div></div></div>"},"75304":{"type":"graphic_table","displayName":"Therapeutic roles for hyperbaric oxygen","title":"Therapeutic roles for hyperbaric oxygen","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Therapeutic roles for hyperbaric oxygen</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><table cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Air or gas embolism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Carbon monoxide poisoning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decompression sickness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clostridial myonecrosis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crush injury and other forms of traumatic ischemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enhanced healing of problematic wounds, including diabetic wounds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Severe anemia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Actinomycotic brain abscess</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Necrotizing soft tissue infections</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Refractory osteomyelitis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Radiation necrosis of soft tissue and bone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Compromised skin grafts and flaps</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 75304 Version 2.0</div></div></div>"},"75305":{"type":"graphic_diagnosticimage","displayName":"Pelvic lateral compression fracture type I","title":"Pelvic lateral compression fracture: Type I","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div style=\"width: 589px\" class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Pelvic lateral compression fracture: Type I</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><img style=\"width:569px; height:526px;\" src=\"images/EM/75305_Pelvic_lat_comp_fx1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"/></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">A) Type I lateral compression fracture with bilateral superior and inferior rami fractures and left sacral fracture.

Monocytes (Mo) are thought to be the primary cellular target for DV. Serotype crossreactive antibodies (Ab), present at the time of second DV infection, bind to virions without neutralization and then enhance the entry of virus into monocytic cells expressing immunoglobulin receptors (FcγR), as show in the left side of the picture. Serotype crossreactive memory T cells, also present at the time of secondary DV infection, recognize viral antigens in the context of class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. These T cells produce cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta, and lyse DV-infected monocytes. TNF-alpha is also produced in monocytes in response to DV infection and/or interactions with T cells. These cytokines have direct effects on endothelial cells (EC) to induce plasma leakage. Interferon-gamma activates monocytes to increase the expression of MHC molecules and immunoglobulin receptors and the production of TNF-alpha. The complement cascade, activated by virus-antibody complexes and by several cytokines, releases the complement anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a which further increase capillary permeability. Interleukin-2 may contribute by facilitating T cell proliferation.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 75407 Version 2.0</div></div></div>"},"75408":{"type":"graphic_diagnosticimage","displayName":"Disseminated coccidioidomycosis","title":"MRI of patient with disseminated coccidioidomycosis","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div style=\"width: 470px\" class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">MRI of patient with disseminated coccidioidomycosis</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><img style=\"width:294px; height:592px;\" src=\"images/ID/75408_Disseminated_cocci_2.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"/></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">42-year-old woman with paranoid schizophrenia who presented with weight loss, fever, and malaise.

and 13) individually (first three boxed columns) and together (last boxed column). Within each of these groups, the prevalence is shown at three different times in gestation. These include at the time of chorionic villus sampling at about 11 to 13 weeks of gestation, amniocentesis at about 15 to 18 weeks of gestation, and at term. Each row of the table shows these results for a given maternal age (eg, the row \"35 years\" includes women age 35.0 through 35.9, average 35.5 years) at the expected date of delivery. For example, consider a 32.4-year-old woman being counseled prior to a CVS procedure who has no specific indications of an abnormality other than age (eg, no abnormal ultrasound findings or pregnancy history of aneuploidy). The chance that the CVS will identify a fetus with Down syndrome is 1:490, with trisomy 18 is 1:1675, and with trisomy 13 is 1:4475. Together, these pose a current combined risk of 1:350. However, her chance of having a term birth with Down syndrome (1:696), trisomy 18 (1:5990), or trisomy 13 (1:8770) is lower. Together, these pose a term risk of 1:580.</div><div class=\"graphic_footnotes\">CVS: chorionic villus sampling; amnio: amniocentesis.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">References:&#xD;&#xA;<ol>&#xD;&#xA;    <li>Morris JK, Savva GM.

Pigs and humans become infected by ingesting eggs or gravid proglottids <STRONG>(2,7)</STRONG>. Humans are infected by ingestion of eggs spread directly from another tapeworm carrier, from the environment, or by autoinfection. In the latter case, humans infected with adult <EM>T. solium </EM>can ingest eggs produced by that tapeworm, most likely by adherence of eggs to the hands and subsequent spread from hand to mouth. Once eggs are ingested, oncospheres hatch in the intestine <STRONG innerHtml>(3,8)</STRONG>, invade the intestinal wall, and migrate to striated muscles as well as the brain and other tissues, where they develop into cysticerci <STRONG>(9)</STRONG>. In humans, cysts may cause serious sequellae if they localize in the brain, resulting in neurocysticercosis. The parasite life cycle is completed, resulting in human tapeworm infection, when humans ingest undercooked pork containing cysticerci <STRONG>(4)</STRONG>.

Other approaches are reasonable and are used successfully by other experts. For example, some clinicians routinely proceed directly to an anti-TNF agent instead of using immunomodulator monotherapy, or choose biologic agents in a different order.</div><div class=\"graphic_footnotes\">&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;6-MP: mercaptopurine; AZA: azathioprine; MTX: methotrexate; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; PCDAI: pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index.<br />&#x9;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;* Risk factors for complicated disease include severe perianal disease; steroid unresponsiveness; deep colonic fissuring; extensive disease involving the mid-small bowel; or severe growth failure in late puberty.<br />&#x9;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&para; Surgical resection also may be appropriate in some patients with growth failure and whose disease is limited to a discrete area of the intestine.<br />&#x9;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&Delta; The choice between infliximab and adalimumab typically depends on clinician and patient preferences, such as a preference for subcutaneous administration (adalimumab) versus infusions (infliximab).<br />&#x9;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;<span class=\"lozenge\">&loz;</span> Expert opinion varies about how long to continue combination therapy after starting infliximab or adalimumab. Infliximab with low-dose MTX is increasingly used for combination therapy, primarily due to concerns about malignancy risk with 6MP/AZA. Some clinicians elect to use anti-TNF monotherapy with careful monitoring of therapeutic drug levels instead of combination treatment. For a discussion of the relative risks and benefits, refer to the text of the topic on management of Crohn disease in children and adolescents.<br />&#x9;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&sect; Severe adverse effects that warrant discontinuation of infliximab or adalimumab include a severe infusion reaction, refractory psoriasis, drug-induced lupus, or serum sickness. In case a drug is stopped because of an opportunistic infection, it is reasonable to consider resuming the original drug once the infection is cleared.<br />&#x9;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&yen; A good response is suggested by improvement in clinical symptoms within four to eight weeks, or a sustained decrease in PCDAI score by 12.5 or more points, ideally confirmed within three to six months by objective data (eg, improvements in erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], repeat imaging with magnetic resonance enterography [MRE], or colonoscopy).<br />&#x9;&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;&#8225; Infliximab dosing starts at 5 mg/kg per dose IV. If the response to standard dosing is incomplete, the treatment may be escalated by increasing the dose to 10 mg/kg and/or by increasing the frequency of infusions. Adalimumab treatment is typically escalated by increasing the frequency of administration from once every two weeks to once a week. Dose escalation is generally attempted before changing to a different drug, but therapeutic drug monitoring of levels and antibodies is suggested to help determine whether dose escalation or changing medications is warranted. For example, patients who have active disease, low levels of infliximab, and low or no levels of antibodies to infliximab may benefit from dose escalation. In contrast, patients with low infliximab concentrations and high titers of antibodies to infliximab will most likely need a different agent.

When vascular cells are damaged, platelets bind to exposed collagen via glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX receptors complexed to von Willebrand factor. These bound platelets undergo degranulation, releasing adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and numerous other substances, including thromboxane A2, serotonin, and epinephrine, that play a role in the recruitment and aggregation process. The released ADP binds to two types of receptors, a low-affinity type 2 purinergic receptor (P2Y12) and a high-affinity purinergic receptor (P2Y1). Ticlopidine and clopidogrel block the binding of ADP to the type 2 purinergic receptor and prevent activation of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor complex and the subsequent aggregation of platelets. The GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists prevent platelet aggregation by blocking the binding of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor to fibrinogen, thereby inhibiting fibrinogen-platelet bridging.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Reprinted by permission from Sharis PJ, Cannon CP, Loscalzo J.

This couple had a child with Hb D-Iran-beta0 thalassemia who presented with moderate hypochromic microcytic anemia and hence was referred for consultation.<br> The downward arrows indicate the first nucleotide after the insertion of a &quot;G&quot;. This disrupts the reading frame of the rest of the beta globin gene as can be seen in the garbled sequence (peaks of various colors on top of each other), which results from the frameshift on the mutated allele and the continued normal sequence on the other allele. The bracket underneath shows the start of the frameshift. &quot;N&quot; indicates any nucleotide that the system is unable to clearly identify and read as a &quot;C&quot; (blue), &quot;T&quot; (red), &quot;G&quot; (black), and &quot;A&quot; (green). Since the sequence to the right of the arrow (insertion of &quot;G&quot;) is frameshifted and difficult to read, there are a lot of &quot;N&quot;s. The normal pattern should be like Part B of the graph where the sequence can be read clearly and nucleotides clearly identified except for where pointed by the arrow, which denotes the mutation. Instead of a normal &quot;G&quot; that should be in this position, there is a &quot;C&quot; in the mutated allele, and therefore, underneath the arrow, in addition to a &quot;G&quot; peak (black), you can also see a &quot;C&quot; (blue). This is the mutation that leads to Hb D-Iran as indicated above.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 75837 Version 3.0</div></div></div>"},"75838":{"type":"graphic_table","displayName":"Physical activity assessment in children","title":"Assessment of physical activity in children","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Assessment of physical activity in children</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><table cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody> <tr> <td class=\"subtitle1_single\">Sedentary behaviors</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hours spent watching television, including videos or movies</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hours spent playing video games (hand-held, internet or on-line, or television/video-based)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hours spent on computer or in internet-based activities, aside from school work</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hours spent talking on telephone or texting</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hours spent doing productive sedentary behaviors, such as homework, reading, and computer-based learning</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"subtitle1_single\">Physical activity behaviors</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Type, frequency, duration, and intensity of structured physical activity (organized physical activity, such as sports)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Time spent in unstructured play (eg, outside play, and routine activity such as walking to school)</td> </tr> </tbody></table></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">Example of questions to ask for a brief semi-quantitative assessment of physical activity in children.

Receptor-specific or mixed specificity ligands bind to the ligand binding domain (E region) of the ERs to cause a ligand-specific perturbation in the receptor complex that creates opportunities for the complex to bind either coactivators or corepressors on the external surface (decision 2). The interactive proteins shunt the ER complex into transcriptionally active or inactive states. Although the expanding family of coregulators are being defined, this does not exclude the possibility that other interactive proteins could alter gene transcription through phosphorylation activation. This could be initiated rapidly either by membrane ER or constitutively through cell surface growth factor receptors. The next decision point (3) is where the complex or coregulators are ubiquitinated and destroyed by the proteasome or accumulate to become promiscuous estrogen-like complexes. Again, phosphorylation may play an important role in the activity of the ER complex. The decision (4) to interact with the machinery involved with gene transcription can shunt the signaling pathway from positive or negative regulation based upon the ER concerned, the ligand, or whether there is a direct interaction with an estrogen response element (ERE) or a tethered interaction to proteins at AP-1 or SP-1 sites. Overall, the decision network creates a complex regulatory system at target tissues or in cancer where a growth advantage can be exploited in response to antiestrogen therapies.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Reproduced with permission from: Jordan VC.

NRT is safer and less addictive than cigarettes and does not create a new addiction. The safety and effectiveness of nicotine replacement products in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. However, no specific medical risk is known or expected in nicotine dependent adolescents. For any product one must decide whether the potential benefits justify the potential risk. Because some nicotine replacement products are available over the counter and may be accessible to teens, adolescents who indicate that they plan to use them should be counseled regarding proper use.</div><div class=\"graphic_footnotes\">* Oral products can be used on a regular schedule to avoid nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and can also be used to relieve acute urges to smoke. Each of these may have an initial unpleasant taste, which can be a barrier to correct use; most users become tolerant to the taste within a few days. Patients should not eat or drink acidic beverages (coffee, juice, or soda) for 15 minutes before or during use of these oral products.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Courtesy of Drs.

Residual malignant disease was tracked via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, using the ratio of BCR-ABL to ABL (graph on left). The time course for attainment of donor T-cell chimerism (percent T-cells of donor origin) is shown on the right. One to three months post-HCT, no patient achieved molecular CR (ie, minimal residual disease [MRD] negative status), a time when only two (1 month) or eight (3 months) of 15 patients had achieved full donor T-cell chimerism (ie, 100 percent donor T-cells). At six months, 12 of the 14 tested patients had achieved full donor chimerism, by which time most (8 of the 10 tested) had also achieved molecular CR. These graphs show that attainment of molecular CR following non-myeloablative HCT requires the presence of a graft-versus-leukemia effect, which is not maximally effective until virtually all of the patient's T-cells are of donor origin. This is in contrast to conventional (myeloablative) HCT, following which most patients have 100 percent donor T-cell chimerism and are MRD negative within one to three months of transplantation.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Data from Uzunel, M, et al.

In the graph in panel B, RV (RVEDd) and LV end diastolic diameters (LVEDd) are plotted against one another and demonstrate a negative correlation, a result of reciprocation of the chambers within the pericardium. Since the pericardium is a rigid box, as respiration brings more blood into the RV, there is less room in the LV; blood pools in the inflating lungs during inspiration. This blood plus the increased stroke volume sent to the lungs during RV inspiratory expansion reaches the lLV during expiration. As the LV expands, the RV is compressed.

The balloon catheter has been introduced from the right femoral vein, crosses the interatrial septum after a transseptal catheterization, and has been manipulated across the mitral valve into the left ventricle with the balloon deflated. During inflation, the distal portion of the balloon expands first and the catheter is pulled back slightly with resistance being felt from the stenotic valve. Additional inflation then expands the rear or proximal portion of the balloon, thus locking the balloon within the stenotic valve. The final inflation expands the mid-portion resulting in a controlled transmission of force resulting in a splitting of the fused commissures. The rapid inflation-deflation sequence shown here results in no important period of hypotension; most patients have little awareness of the inflation. The other catheters seen in the image are a pigtail catheter in the left ventricle and a pulmonary artery thermodilution cardiac output catheter.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Courtesy of John D Carroll, MD.
