The initial inflammatory response following the first episode of ARC determines the degree and extent of structural involvement of the MV apparatus. Severe inflammation of the chordal structures and MV leaflets often lead to severe MR in the very young, whereas moderate inflammation followed by repeated bouts of ARC is more likely to cause mixed MV disease (MR and MS) later in life. Isolated MS is usually the consequence of milder or even subclinical forms of ARC followed by episodes of recurrent carditis. In developing countries where the risk of recurrent ARC is high, MS presents at a younger age and the valve leaflets are more likely to be pliable and not calcified. In Western societies where the risk of recurrent ARC is low, MS presents later in life, and the MV leaflets are more likely to be rigid and calcified.</div><div class=\"graphic_footnotes\">ARC: acute rheumatic carditis; MS: mitral stenosis; MV: mitral valve; MR: mitral regurgitation.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Courtesy of Theo Meyer, MD, PhD.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 104279 Version 3.0</div></div></div>"},"104280":{"type":"graphic_figure","displayName":"Transmitral gradients with varying MVA and HR","title":"Transmitral gradients with varying mitral valve area, heart rate, and cardiac output","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div style=\"width: 568px\" class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Transmitral gradients with varying mitral valve area, heart rate, and cardiac output</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><img style=\"width:548px; height:418px;\" src=\"images/CARD/104280_Gorlinformula.gif\" alt=\"Image\"/></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">Using the Gorlin formula, the relationship between heart rate, mean transmitral gradient, and four different MVAs (2, 1.5, 1, and 0.7 cm<SUP>2</SUP>) are shown at a cardiac output of 5 liters/min.

PVH promotes broncho-pulmonary venous anastomoses and passively increases pulmonary arterial pressures. In another group of patients with mitral stenosis, PAH bears little relationship to the LA pressure. This type of reactive PAH is due to vasoconstriction and pathological remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature (medial hypertrophy and intimal hyperplasia). The vascular remodeling and in-situ arteriolar thrombosis promote progressive PAH, RV pressure overload, RV dilation, and TR.</div><div class=\"graphic_footnotes\">RV: right ventricular; TR: tricuspid regurgitation; PAH: pulmonary arterial hypertension; PVH: pulmonary venous hypertension; LA: left atrial.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Courtesy of Theo Meyer, MD, PhD.</div><div id=\"graphicVersion\">Graphic 104283 Version 3.0</div></div></div>"},"104381":{"type":"graphic_diagnosticimage","displayName":"Proximal interphalangeal joint dislocation in a child","title":"Proximal interphalangeal joint dislocation in a child","html":"<div class=\"graphic\"><div style=\"width: 666px\" class=\"figure\"><div class=\"ttl\">Proximal interphalangeal joint dislocation in a child</div><div class=\"cntnt\"><img style=\"width:646px; height:722px;\" src=\"images/EM/104381_Prx_intrphlng_jnt_dslct_chld.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"/></div><div class=\"graphic_lgnd\">(A) This child sustained a proximal interphalangeal joint dislocation of the little finger (fifth digit).

However, two subgroups of APS patients should be recognized, according to: (a) the presence; and (b) the absence of additional risk factors for thrombosis. Indicative (but not exhaustive) cases include: age (&gt;55 in men and &gt;65 in women) and the presence of any of the established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elevated LDL or low HDL cholesterol, cigarette smoking, family history of premature cardiovascular disease, body mass index ≥30 kg m<SUP>–2</SUP>, microalbuminuria, estimated GFR &lt;60 mL minute<SUP>–1</SUP>), inherited thrombophilias, oral contraceptives, nephrotic syndrome, malignancy, immobilization, and surgery. Thus, patients who fulfill criteria should be stratified according to contributing causes of thrombosis.<br />Δ A thrombotic episode in the past could be considered as a clinical criterion, provided that thrombosis is proved by appropriate diagnostic means and that no alternative diagnosis or cause of thrombosis is found.<br /><FONT class=lozenge>◊</FONT> Superficial venous thrombosis is not included in the clinical criteria.<br />§ Generally accepted features of placental insufficiency include: (i) abnormal or non-reassuring fetal surveillance test(s), eg, a non-reactive non-stress test, suggestive of fetal hypoxemia; (ii) abnormal Doppler flow velocimetry waveform analysis suggestive of fetal hypoxemia, eg, absent end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery; (iii) oligohydramnios, eg, an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm or less; or (iv) a postnatal birth weight less than the 10th percentile for the gestational age.<br />¥ Investigators are strongly advised to classify APS patients in studies into one of the following categories: I, more than one laboratory criteria present (any combination); IIa, LA present alone; IIb, aCL antibody present alone; IIc, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody present alone.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">From: Miyakis S, Lockshin MD, Atsumi T, et al.

Although this regimen was used effectively before gentamicin was established as the preferred aminoglycoside, AHA 2015 guidelines discourage its use. This is because of general lack of physician familiarity with streptomycin, supply shortages, lack of readily available laboratory testing for serum concentration monitoring, and cranial nerve VIII toxicity (refer to&nbsp;text).<br />Δ Patients with NVE and symptoms &lt;3 months may be treated for 4 weeks; patients with PVE or NVE with symptoms ≥3 months should be treated for at least 6 weeks.<br /><FONT class=lozenge>◊</FONT> In adults, streptomycin is dosed based on ideal body weight.

Gravid females drop off the second host after feeding to lay eggs <strong>(1)</strong>, usually in the fall. Eggs hatch into six-legged larvae <strong>(2)</strong> and overwinter in this stage. The following spring, the larvae seek out and attach to the first host <strong>(3)</strong>, usually a rodent or lagomorph. The larvae molt into nymphs on the first host <strong>(3a-3b)</strong>. Engorged nymphs drop off the first host, usually in the late summer or fall <strong>(4)</strong> and overwinter in the nymphal stage. Nymphs molt into adults the following spring <strong>(5)</strong> and seek out the second host <strong>(6)</strong>, which is usually a larger herbivore (bovids, cervids, etc). Adults feed on the second host during the summer and mate. In the fall, females drop off the second host to continue the cycle. Females may reattach and feed multiple times. Humans may serve as first or second hosts for ticks with this life cycle. Also, the second host does not necessarily have to be a separate species or even a separate individual as the first host.</div><div class=\"graphic_reference\">Reproduced from: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If negative, liver biopsy should be performed. On liver biopsy,&nbsp;a diagnosis of Wilson disease is established if the hepatic copper concentration is ≥250 mcg/g dry weight; a diagnosis is excluded if the hepatic copper concentration is &lt;50 mcg/g dry weight; if the hepatic copper concentration is ≥50 and &lt;250 mcg/g dry weight, molecular genetic testing for mutations in ATP7B should be performed (if not already done)&nbsp;to establish or exclude the diagnosis.<br />§ Most patients with Wilson disease are compound heterozygotes. The identification of one mutation supports the diagnosis, and the identification of two mutations confirms the diagnosis.
