Fragments of partially degraded GAGs accumulate in the lysosomes, resulting in cellular dysfunction and clinical abnormalities. The clinical features and diagnosis of the MPS are reviewed here. The management of these disorders and associated complications are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucopolysaccharidoses-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucopolysaccharidoses: Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2782363569\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The MPS are rare conditions, with an estimated total incidence of all types of MPS of approximately 1 in 20,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are large, complex polymers of linear, repeating sulfated acidic and amino sugar disaccharide units attached to a protein core. They are widely distributed in many tissues, where they play important roles. As examples, they are components of the ground substance of bone and cartilage, lubricant in joint fluid, and the surface coating that initially binds growth factors to cells.</p><p>The metabolic recycling of GAGs requires the stepwise degradation of the terminal sulfate, acidic, and amino sugar residues by a series of lysosomal enzymes. The deficiency of one of these enzymes blocks degradation of the substrate and results in a specific disorder. The clinical phenotype of the disorder depends upon both the amount of residual enzyme activity and the distribution and turnover of the substrate affected by the deficiency, rather than the distribution of the enzyme.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2023896818\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All of the MPS are autosomal recessive disorders, with the exception of MPS II, which is X linked. The affected genes and chromosomal locations are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57733\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57733 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The phenotype of these disorders covers a broad spectrum, from mild to severe. In general, the severity depends upon the quantity of residual enzyme, which is related to the genotype of the affected patient. Mutations that permit small amounts of residual enzyme activity result in less severe clinical phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These residual amounts may be less than 1 percent of normal and may not be detectable by routine assay. Mild to intermediate forms are also referred to as the &quot;attenuated phenotypes.&quot; Phenotype can vary among affected siblings due to other unknown genetic or environmental factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION AND PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The MPS disorders are classified as types I II, III, IV (A or B), VI, VII, and IX. MPS V (formerly Scheie syndrome) and MPS VIII are no longer recognized. The MPS disorders are differentiated clinically by their clinical features and age of presentation and biochemically by their associated enzyme deficiency. They can be grouped into four broad categories according to their dominant clinical features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57733\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57733 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue storage and skeletal disease with or without brain disease (MPS I, II, VII)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue and skeletal disease (MPS VI)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primarily skeletal disorders (MPS IV A and B)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primarily central nervous system (CNS) disorders (MPS III A to D)</p><p/><p>Signs and symptoms of MPS are usually not present at birth, with the exception of the more severe forms of MPS VII (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57733\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57733 \">table 1</a>). Most types present within the first few years of life, but some of the attenuated forms (MPS I, II, and some cases of MPS VII and MPS VI) can present as late as adolescence to early adulthood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831481035\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic pattern of skeletal abnormalities in MPS disorders is known as dysostosis multiplex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. This condition occurs in MPS I, II, IV, VI, and VII and is less extensive in MPS III and milder variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. A radiographic skeletal survey should be performed and interpreted by a radiologist experienced with the findings in storage diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucopolysaccharidoses-complications#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucopolysaccharidoses: Complications&quot;, section on 'Dysostosis multiplex'</a>.)</p><p>The following are typical radiographic findings of dysostosis multiplex:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The long bones are short and thick and have an irregular, hyperostotic shaft and metaphysis due to inadequate remodeling. The distal radius and ulna have an abnormal angulation and tilting of the distal epiphyses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51207\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51207 \">image 1</a>). The clavicle is similarly abnormal in shape with widened ends.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The iliac bones are flared, with a flattened acetabulum and coxa valga deformity (widening of the angle formed by the femoral neck and shaft).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The metacarpals narrow proximally and widen distally with irregular ends (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63875\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63875 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoplasia of the anterosuperior areas of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebral bodies results in ovoid vertebrae with a beaked appearance of their anterior inferior surfaces on a lateral radiograph and leads to development of vertebral slippage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52046\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52046 \">image 3</a>) and dorsal kyphosis (gibbus deformity) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75426%7EPEDS%2F81903\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75426 graphicRef81903 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ribs have a characteristic &quot;oar shape&quot; with a narrowing at the takeoff from the vertebral column and a broadening of the anterior distal end. These broadened ribs give the appearance of decreased intercostal spaces and a &quot;beehive&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50673\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50673 \">image 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skull is large and deformed due to craniosynostosis, with a thickened calvarium and an abnormal &quot;j&quot; or boot-shaped sella turcica (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75624\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75624 \">image 5</a>). The basilar skull may impress upon or fuse with the cervical vertebrae. This is associated with a narrowed spinal canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucopolysaccharidoses-complications#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucopolysaccharidoses: Complications&quot;, section on 'Cervical cord compression'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175318269\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF SPECIFIC DISORDERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">MPS type I</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MPS type I (MIM #252800) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal hydrolase, alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA), which is needed for the degradation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. MPS I is caused by mutations in the <em>IDUA</em> gene, located on chromosome 4p16.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The syndrome that results depends in part upon the specific combination of mutations on both alleles that determines the level of residual enzyme activity. The latter can also be influenced by the presence of polymorphisms within the gene.</p><p>MPS I includes Hurler (MPS I H, MIM #607014), Hurler-Scheie (MPS I <span class=\"nowrap\">H/S,</span> MIM #607015), and Scheie (MPS I S, MIM #607016) syndromes. The clinical phenotype covers a broad spectrum of severity. Patients with severe, intermediate, and mild features are classified as Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes, respectively. Hurler-Scheie and Scheie syndromes are referred to as &quot;attenuated phenotypes&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Early recognition of the attenuated phenotypes is critical so that enzyme replacement therapy can be initiated before the development of significant morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In one series of 29 patients with attenuated phenotypes, median age of diagnosis was five years (range 1.3 to 40 years) despite onset of symptoms at a median age of two years (range four months to nine years). Presenting symptoms included joint stiffness, corneal clouding, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections with chronic rhinitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucopolysaccharidoses-treatment#H1496607896\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucopolysaccharidoses: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Enzyme replacement therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Hurler syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hurler syndrome is the severe form of MPS I and is characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical problems, including skeletal abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe intellectual disability (mental retardation). The incidence is approximately 1 to 3 in 100,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,19</a>].</p><p>Affected infants appear normal at birth. During the first year, they develop the characteristic coarse facial features, wide nasal bridge, and flattened midface. Other signs include hepatosplenomegaly, umbilical or inguinal hernias, and typical skeletal abnormalities, known as dysostosis multiplex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52046\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52046 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63875\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63875 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75624\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75624 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Patients typically present at six months to two years of age with developmental delay and recurrent respiratory infections with chronic nasal discharge. Hurler patients may also present with other problems, including rapidly enlarging head size due to craniosynostosis and hyperostosis of the skull, heart failure, hernias, and gibbus deformity of the lower spine, before their facial features and other abnormalities make the diagnosis obvious (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75426%7EPEDS%2F81903\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75426 graphicRef81903 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p>Growth, which may be increased during the first year, slows by two to three years of age and becomes minimal. Patients may develop progressive joint stiffness and contractures, which limit mobility and are painful. Development peaks by two to three years, usually with multiword sentences and walking, and then declines. High-pressure communicating hydrocephalus can exacerbate the enlargement and deformity of the head and may accelerate the developmental decline in some Hurler patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75849\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75849 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55994\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55994 \">image 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22</a>].</p><p>Loss of vision and hearing may worsen the progressive developmental decline. Corneal clouding is a characteristic feature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52924 \">picture 2</a>). It is caused by structural changes in the corneal stroma, including abnormalities of the size, spacing, and arrangement of collagen fibrils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Blindness may develop due to corneal clouding, retinal disease, optic nerve compression, or primary brain disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>]. Combined conductive and sensorineural hearing loss often occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Patients often develop frequent ear, sinus, and pulmonary infections with thick secretions that lead to emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Soft tissue thickening in the nose and pharynx and hypertrophy of the tonsils and adenoids due to storage of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in these tissues along with abnormalities in tracheal cartilage cause progressive airway obstruction and sleep apnea and may result in a difficult airway if intubation is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In some patients, unrecognized sleep apnea can cause significant hypoxemia at night, leading to pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-and-predisposing-factors-for-sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms and predisposing factors for sleep-related breathing disorders in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac abnormalities become apparent between birth and five years of age. These may include cardiomyopathy, endocardial fibroelastosis, and valvular regurgitation, which alone or in combination can lead to heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. GAG storage within blood vessels causes irregular and diffuse narrowing of the coronary arteries and irregular lesions of the aorta in untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>].</p><p>Other problems include umbilical and inguinal hernias. Gibbus deformity (dorsal kyphosis) can be apparent in the first few months of life. Arthropathy, including the hip joint, is progressive. Joint stiffness is universal and progressive, leading to painful and impaired movement of shoulders and legs. Fixed flexion contracture of the fingers along with carpal tunnel syndrome leads to the typical hand deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64899\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64899 \">picture 3</a>). Carpal tunnel syndrome can be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It may develop insidiously and without typical symptoms and thus is often unrecognized. Odontoid dysplasia and anterior C1-C2 subluxation occur frequently and can cause cord compression and sudden death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58332\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58332 \">image 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72193\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72193 \">image 9</a>).</p><p>Lifespan is markedly shortened in Hurler syndrome. The average age at death is five years, and nearly all patients die before 10 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Hurler-Scheie syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hurler&ndash;Scheie syndrome is intermediate in severity. It is typically diagnosed by two to six years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one series of 15 patients, joint stiffness was the most frequent presenting complaint (in six patients), followed by recurrent ear, nose, and throat symptoms due to airway narrowing, thicker mucus, and recurrent infections and umbilical hernia (each in four patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Hurler-Scheie is less common than Hurler.</p><p>Characteristic facial features are less coarsened than in Hurler syndrome and often include a small mandible. Progressive Achilles tendon contractures lead to toe walking. Hepatosplenomegaly can be substantial and can cause discomfort or respiratory compromise. Progressive cardiac valve disease may cause severe aortic and mitral regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients often develop spondylolisthesis (subluxation of the vertebra) and kyphoscoliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The meninges are often thickened, causing progressive circumferential compression of the cervical spinal cord (pachymeningitis cervicalis), which may sometimes lead to weakness or paralysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72193\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72193 \">image 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Hurler-Scheie, although severe, progresses less rapidly than Hurler syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Patients usually have normal intelligence, although static learning disabilities are not uncommon. Lifespan is shortened. Patients typically die in their twenties of cardiac disease or respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Scheie syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scheie syndrome is the least severe form of MPS I, although it is not a mild disease. Patients may be diagnosed as late as the teenage years due in part to their mildly affected facies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one series of 10 patients, the most frequent presenting features were joint stiffness and corneal clouding (each present in five patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Scheie patients suffer from significant joint stiffness and pain, which can be debilitating. Aortic valve disease often requires valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Corneal clouding, optical nerve compression, or other related eye problems can lead to blindness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52924 \">picture 2</a>). Many problems that occur in Hurler-Scheie syndrome also affect Scheie patients (eg, hydrocephalus or cord compression) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74009\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74009 \">image 10</a>). Most will have carpal tunnel syndrome.</p><p>In general, lifespan is longer than with the other MPS I subtypes. Some Scheie patients have a normal lifespan, although they have significant disability. Most die in their middle decades.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">MPS type II (Hunter syndrome)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MPS II (MIM #309900) is also known as Hunter syndrome. This X-linked disorder is caused by a deficiency of iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS), which results in storage of heparan and dermatan sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. MPS II is caused by mutations in the <em>IDS</em> gene, located on chromosome Xq28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Deletion of contiguous genes has been reported in patients with severe Hunter syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although the disorder is X linked, cases in females have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-47</a>].</p><p>Hunter syndrome occurs as part of a wide clinical spectrum, although the correlation between the somatic and cognitive aspects of the disorder is less clear than in MPS I. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,48</a>]. The severe form shares features with Hurler syndrome, including abnormal facial appearance, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiovascular disorders due to mucopolysaccharide deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], dysostosis multiplex with dwarfism, neurocognitive decline, and deafness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74702\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74702 \">picture 4</a>). However, Hunter syndrome is differentiated by its later onset (one to two years of age), slower clinical course, and absence of corneal clouding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Distinctive pearly papular skin lesions over the scapulae and on the lateral upper arms and thighs develop in some Hunter patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65695\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65695 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Some patients with the severe form have aggressive hyperactive behavior similar to Sanfilippo syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In one series, issues with behavior, sleep, and <span class=\"nowrap\">bowel/bladder</span> training were markers for central nervous system (CNS) involvement and subsequent cognitive dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Rarely, a patient may present before the onset of signs and symptoms of MPS due to the history of an affected family member. Newborn screening is not available for MPS. The distinctive skeletal findings may help with diagnosis. As an example, the abnormal ovoid or beaked vertebral bodies and the oar-shaped ribs may be noted on a chest radiograph of an affected infant who has recurrent pneumonia. However, the initial presentation may be subtle, and signs may be variable, depending upon the MPS type and severity, resulting in frequent delays in diagnosis.</p><p>As a result, a comprehensive biochemical evaluation may be needed for patients who present early in the course of disease. Measurement of urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) concentration, fractionation of GAG by electrophoresis or chromatography, and analysis of oligosaccharides can identify the types of MPS and can also identify oligosaccharidoses and other storage disorders in the differential. Definitive diagnosis requires assay of enzyme activity, usually in peripheral blood leukocytes. Azurophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (Alder-Reilly granules) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70847\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70847 \">picture 10</a>) have been described in some patients and are another potential clue to the diagnosis, although they are not specific to any MPS subtype and may occur in other disorders.

Both a quantitative test of total GAG and a fractionation method, such as electrophoresis or chromatography, to distinguish among the different types of GAGs should be performed. First morning urine specimens should be tested because they are relatively concentrated. Dilute urine may be falsely negative, especially in disorders with lower levels of urinary GAG, such as MPS III and IV. The test should be performed by a qualified biochemical genetics laboratory experienced with GAG quantitation and electrophoretic or chromatography methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">99-101</a>]. Normal newborns and infants have significantly higher GAG levels than older children. As a result, comparison with age-specific controls and fractionation to verify pathologic GAG (heparan, dermatan, keratan) from common normal GAG (other chondroitins) is important to avoid false-positive results.</p><p>Methods that should <strong>not</strong> be used are spot tests or those that do not fractionate the GAGs. The former, such as the Berry spot test, may give false-positive results due to the normal high excretion of GAG in children younger than one year of age. Tests that do not fractionate GAGs may be falsely positive or negative due to the inability to distinguish abnormal GAG from high turnover of normal GAG or to detect relatively small amounts and fragment sizes of some pathologic species (eg, heparan sulfate and keratan sulfate).</p><p>In normal individuals, urinary GAG concentrations are highest at birth, fall substantially during the first few months of age, and then progressively decline during childhood and adolescence. The analysis is usually sensitive in MPS I, II, VI, and VII because urinary GAG excretion is markedly elevated in these disorders, except in attenuated patients.</p><p>Urine testing may be falsely negative in MPS III and IV. In MPS III, this is due to lower urinary GAG levels and smaller heparan sulfate fragments than in the other MPS diseases. In MPS IV, analysis of urine may be unreliable because keratan sulfate levels decline with age in this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>].

Results of the urine GAGs guide enzyme analysis. Tests for the enzymes deficient in MPS I, III B, IV B, and VII, which cleave sugar moieties, are usually available in clinical genetics laboratories. These tests use artificial fluorescent substrates. Assays for sulfatases (MPS II, III D, IV A, and VI), acetylase (MPS III C), and sulfamidase (MPS III A) are more difficult to perform reliably and use radioactive substrates. These tests are available only in specialized laboratories. Tandem mass spectrometry assays using dried blood spots have been developed for a number of subtypes and have the potential to be used for newborn screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/104-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">104-106</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2593035943\"><span class=\"h2\">Mutation analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutation analysis usually shows the high frequency of rare &quot;private&quot; mutations in these disorders.

Prenatal testing can be performed for all of the MPS disorders by chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis. Prenatal testing by genotyping (mutation analysis) is preferred if the respective individual carriers have been tested and the familial mutations are known. Genetic testing can also be performed preimplantation. Enzyme analysis is performed if the specific mutations are not known. Direct enzyme assay on material obtained by chorion villus biopsy is the most commonly used method because it avoids the need for tissue culture, providing results more quickly than amniocytes in culture. Enzyme activity can also be measured in cultured fibroblasts obtained by amniocentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>] and in dried fetal blood spots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mucopolysaccharidoses-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,111</a>].

One of the challenges in diagnosing MPS is that the various presenting features initially may be evaluated separately by different specialists, and it may take time to recognize that the seemingly unconnected health problems have a single unifying diagnosis. In the patient whose main presenting feature is hip disease, for example, the differential diagnosis may include Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes (LCP) disease and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED). In contrast, if developmental delay and behavior problems are the primary presenting features, then the differential would include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There are still other disorders in the differential for corneal clouding, obstructive sleep apnea, hearing loss, and kyphoscoliosis. Once the constellation of findings is recognized as having a common underlying cause, the main disorders in the differential are other storage diseases, including the oligosaccharidoses (eg, alpha- and beta- mannosidosis, fucosidosis, aspartylglucosaminuria), sphingolipidoses (eg, Gaucher type II, Niemann Pick A), and mucolipidoses (eg, I cell disease). Urinary analysis of glycosaminoglycans and oligosaccharides helps differentiate these disorders.
