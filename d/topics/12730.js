Clomiphene was a revolutionary advance in reproductive medicine and quickly became popular for induction of ovulation because of its ease of administration and minimal side effects. Ironically, it was initially synthesized as a synthetic estrogen for possible use as a contraceptive.</p><p>The pharmacology, indications, and administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate will be reviewed here. Other drugs for induction of ovulation are discussed elsewhere.

It acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), similar to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a>. All three drugs are competitive inhibitors of estrogen binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) and have mixed agonist and antagonist activity, depending upon the target tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of action of selective estrogen receptor modulators and down-regulators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The commercially available form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> is the dihydrogen citrate salt (clomiphene citrate). It contains two stereoisomers: zu-clomiphene (38 percent) and en-clomiphene (62 percent), which were originally called the cis-isomer and trans-isomer, respectively. En-clomiphene is cleared rapidly, while zu-clomiphene has a long half-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The two clomiphene isomers have mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects that vary among species. En-clomiphene is the more potent isomer with greater antiestrogenic activity and the one primarily responsible for inducing follicular development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clomiphene</a> is cleared through the liver and excreted in feces. Over 50 percent of an oral dose of 14C-labeled clomiphene citrate is excreted after five days, but traces of radioactivity from the labeled clomiphene appear in the feces up to six weeks after administration. Although this observation raises concerns about fetal exposure to clomiphene, most studies suggest that the frequency of congenital malformations is not increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
