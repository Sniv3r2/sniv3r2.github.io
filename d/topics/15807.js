For example, in the United States, it accounts for roughly 500 new cases annually. The incidence of SCC of the bladder may be increasing, based upon Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data from the United States where the incidence rose from 0.05 to 0.14 cases per 100,000 population between 1991 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but this still represents fewer than 1 percent of all bladder tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In a 2011 analysis of patients with SCC in the SEER database, the following was noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men are affected more commonly than women (76 versus 24 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median age at diagnosis of SCC is 73 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median overall survival was 11 months, but outcomes varied substantially based upon the presence or absence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis.</p><p/><p>A past history of smoking has been associated with SCC of the bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of SCC of the bladder are similar to those of other bladder tumors and reflect the presence of a mass.</p><p>In a Rare Cancer Network series of 107 patients, the following presenting symptoms were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematuria (86 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureteral obstruction and acute renal failure (13 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysuria and frequency (29 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematospermia (n = 1)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent urinary tract infections (n = 1)</p><p/><p>In another series, the diagnosis of SCC was incidentally made in 7 percent of patients during surveillance cystoscopy following a prior diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. SCC is sometimes identified during surgery for a bladder tumor whose histology initially appeared to be urothelial based upon transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT).

A series with 11 small cell cases found that progestin receptor expression was more common in SCC compared with urothelial carcinoma, along with higher c-kit, topoisomerase 2, tubulin 3, ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1, and topoisomerase 1 expression, suggesting distinct molecular phenotypes and pathways between small cell and conventional urothelial-derived cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27382522\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The staging of SCC of the bladder uses the same tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system as is used for other bladder cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110763 \">table 1</a>).

For patients in whom a response to chemotherapy is achieved, this is followed by locoregional primary tumor-directed treatment using either cystectomy or RT.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with localized disease (stage II or III) whose overall condition permits aggressive therapy, we suggest neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a platinum-based combination (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients who respond to treatment, we suggest cystectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to cystectomy, we suggest adjuvant platinum-based combination chemotherapy if the overall condition of the patient permits (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Disease localized to the bladder'</a> above). Our preferred regimen for chemotherapy is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following definitive treatment, we suggest not administering prophylactic cranial irradiation for these patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1483044238\" class=\"local\">'Role of prophylactic cranial irradiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who do not respond to neoadjuvant therapy and for those who present with disseminated disease, we proceed with systemic chemotherapy. We suggest the use of regimens that are active in advanced SCC of the lung (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>), including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> for previously untreated patients, and agents including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a>, anthracyclines, alkylating agents, and vinca alkaloids.
