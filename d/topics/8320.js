These findings gave rise to the concept of an estrogen receptor (ER). It has since become clear that human breast cancers are dependent upon estrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone for growth and that this effect is mediated through ERs and progesterone receptors (PRs). Not surprisingly, ERs and PRs are both overexpressed in malignant breast tissue.</p><p>New insights into hormone receptor biology and the increasing array of proteins that can modify their function have already translated into better therapies for breast cancer. As an example, a number of drugs that interact with the receptor, including selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER downregulators (SERDs), are approved for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. At the same time, improved methods for assaying receptor proteins have led to less expensive and simpler measurements of ER and PR. Unfortunately, however, these methods have been fraught with variation that has resulted in inaccurate test results. Since these tests guide the use of endocrine therapy in patients with breast cancer, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) convened a panel to address causes of variation related to measurement of ER and PR by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Here we review the clinical utility of hormone receptor testing in breast cancer and the guideline recommendations published in 2010 for measurement of ER and PR in tissue samples by IHC.

However, not all patients with breast cancer benefit from endocrine therapy. Tumor expression of ER <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PR can best identify those women who are most likely to benefit from endocrine therapy. Tumors that are negative for ER and PR are unlikely to respond to endocrine therapy and are better served by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Largely due to their predictive value, measurement of these receptors has become a routine part of the evaluation of breast cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-approach-to-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-her2-negative-breast-cancer-endocrine-therapy-and-targeted-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment approach to metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: Endocrine therapy and targeted agents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant endocrine therapy for non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1315310\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular biology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ER and PR are both members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that includes the androgen and retinoid receptors. These receptors are located in the cytosol of target cells and operate as ligand-dependent transcription factors. Attachment of a lipid-soluble hormone to the ligand-binding domain results in unmasking of the DNA-binding sites on the receptor, followed by migration into the nucleus, and binding to specific hormone-responsive elements near the genes that are responsible for the physiologic actions of the hormone.</p><p>Subsequent steps include transcription of messenger RNA and ribosomal RNA, and the eventual synthesis of new proteins. Two isoforms of the ER have been identified: ER-alpha and ER-beta. Although similar in many respects, the transcriptional properties of both receptors are different. In this review, we will focus on the measurement of ER-alpha only, since virtually all publications that provided evidence for guideline recommendations relate to measurement of this isoform. The molecular biology of the ER is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology and physiology of estrogen action&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of action of selective estrogen receptor modulators and down-regulators&quot;, section on 'Estrogen receptor beta: A second ER isoform'</a>.)</p><p>As with ER, PR protein exists as two receptor isoforms (in this case, called A and B), but these forms are the products of the same gene. These isoforms of PR (A is a slightly truncated form of B) bind with one another to create homo- and heterodimers. There has been little work on the relative significance of these isoforms in clinical tissue specimens and their relevance to clinical decision making, although this is an active area of research.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H713238260\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictive value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ER expression predicts patients who will benefit from endocrine therapy. Although patients with PR-positive tumors also have better outcomes when treated with endocrine therapy, PR status is heavily dependent on ER; therefore, it does not appear that PR has independently predictive value, especially when the ER status is known. The predictive value of hormone-receptor expression for responses to endocrine therapy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer#H682640162\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in early, nonmetastatic breast cancer&quot;, section on 'ER predicting response to endocrine therapy'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1315480\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognostic value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies describe the relationship between hormone receptor levels as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and patient outcomes. Further discussion is covered separately.

Since the early 1990s, such methods have largely been replaced by immunohistochemical (IHC) methods that rely upon the recognition of the receptor protein through the use of specific antibodies. In both cases, the receptor protein is either directly or indirectly measured. A third, newer technique is measurement of ER messenger RNA by either northern blot analysis or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), often as part of a multigene assay method (eg, Oncotype DX, Mammaprint) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. At present, these techniques are not recommended to replace traditional assays.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ligand binding assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prototype method for the ligand binding assay (LBA) is the dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay. Radiolabeled steroid ligand ([125I]-estradiol for ER, [3H]-progestin for PR) is first added to the supernatant of homogenized tissue (representing the cytosol) and incubated to allow labeled steroid to bind all available receptor protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. DCC, which absorbs unbound steroid, is added, after which the charcoal with adherent unbound steroid is separated by centrifugation.</p><p>Since the receptor-bound portion remains in the supernatant and the free fraction is found in the charcoal precipitate, the bound and unbound fractions can then be quantified for a range of concentrations of radiolabeled steroid and the results used to create a multipoint Scatchard plot. From this Scatchard plot, the total concentration of receptor protein in the cytosol is obtained and is usually expressed as femtomoles of receptor protein per mg of total cytosol protein <span class=\"nowrap\">(fmol/mg)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody-based assays (IHC)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability of monoclonal antibodies to the ER in the 1980s had a profound and long lasting impact on the methodologies for ER assay. Initially, quantification was by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that still required preparation of cytosols from homogenates of fresh tissue but was more precise and far less laborious than the DCC assay. The results from the new structurally-specific assay were highly correlated with the old functionally-specific assay, and cut-offs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for EIA (ER positivity &ge;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">fmol/mg</span> cytosol protein) were mostly based upon correlative values with LBA (ER positivity &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">fmol/mg</span> cytosol protein). In addition, use of an optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding compound with frozen breast tumors did not alter either ER or PR results.</p><p>IHC application of hormone receptor-specific antibodies was initially successful only on sections of frozen tissue, but antigen retrieval methods developed in the early 1990s and new antibodies allowed their application to formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded material. The ease of this approach, coupled with the availability of inexpensive reagents that were applicable to routine pathology specimens and the ability to evaluate small cancers and ensure that only invasive tumor cells are assessed, has led to IHC becoming the near universal choice for ER and PR assay determinations since the early 1990s.</p><p>However, much of the data that provided the basis for our knowledge of the relationship between the presence of significant amounts of ER and response to endocrine therapy were derived using the LBA, and positive-negative cut-offs were developed by reference to LBA results. IHC methods have been subject to retrospective comparisons with established methods such as LBA, and there are some published reports indicating that IHC may be more predictive than LBAs in identifying patients who will derive benefit from endocrine therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56559 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/8-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-19</a>].</p><p>IHC assays that identify ER as a nuclear protein in cell fractionation experiments largely support this observation. Signaling through this mechanism is designated the <strong>&quot;genomic&quot; signaling pathway</strong>. However, emerging cell line data show that ER may signal through a separate, <strong>&quot;non-genomic&quot; pathway </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this case, ER is found on the cell membrane and in the cell cytoplasm. This pathway is important, particularly when the epidermal growth factor receptors (including the human epidermal growth factor 2 [HER2] receptor) are also upregulated. ER binds to upregulated EGFR and HER2 receptors, which initiates a cascade of growth factor signaling that leads to PR downregulation and alteration of apoptotic pathway, a mechanism of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-biology-and-physiology-of-estrogen-action#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular biology and physiology of estrogen action&quot;, section on 'Non-genomic actions of estrogens'</a>.) </p><p>IHC can be performed on thin sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, or on sectioned frozen specimens. Initially, 4 to 5 micron sections are cut and mounted on protein-coated glass slides. Sections are heated to uncover hidden protein epitopes and exposed to a primary anti-ER <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-PR antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A secondary antibody that recognizes the first, which is attached to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase, is then added. This linked enzyme converts substrates like diaminobenzidine into colored molecules upon exposure to a developer. Tissue sections are then counterstained, and the amount of ER or PR protein present is semi-quantitated according to the presence of nuclear staining, which may be heterogeneous in malignant epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63384\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63384 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Staining of membranes or cytoplasm may be seen as valid staining, but should <strong>not</strong> be used to define ER or PR positivity. If such staining is seen in both the tumor and the internal control (normal ducts in the specimen), the assay should be repeated because it is likely that the staining is spurious.</p><p>IHC offers several advantages over LBA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be performed on a variety of samples including fine needle aspirates, core biopsies, small tumors, and cell blocks from body fluids such as pleural effusions, frozen tissue, or fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to the LBA, total receptor protein is measured, not just the unbound fraction. As a result, IHC is not affected by endogenous or exogenous steroids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is simple to perform and does not require specialized equipment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As noted above, in some reports, the ability to discriminate estrogen-responsive from estrogen-nonresponsive tumors is somewhat better with IHC than with LBAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/8-10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,13</a>].</p><p/><p>For all of these reasons, IHC has rapidly become the predominant method for measuring ER and PR in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1321780\"><span class=\"h3\">Assay variability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IHC provides two pieces of information: the percentage of positive cells and the intensity of staining within individual cells. Scoring systems (ie, percentage of positive cells versus staining intensity) as well as cutoff points (thresholds) separating positive and negative samples differ among individual laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].</p><p>The reported percentages of positive cells vary according to the method by which the observations are made. Some observers quantitate by overall assessment, some manually count areas of positivity, and others use image analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In contrast to the significant body of data correlating the degree of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> benefit in ER-positive tumors to quantitative ER levels as assessed by LBA (including levels as low as 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">fmol/mg</span> of cytosolic protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]), the importance of quantifying hormone receptor expression by IHC remains an open question. In the Stockholm Breast Cancer Study Group report, for example, the degree of tamoxifen benefit in ER-positive tumors correlated with ER levels by LBA but not with the percentage of cells stained ER-positive by IHC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Reproducible quantitation of IHC results by computer-aided image analysis will likely be valuable in this regard, providing a more accurate classification of ER-positive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/34-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-40</a>]. However, none of these methods is in common use, although at least one is commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and another system is available as an open source, web-based image analysis system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Use of image analysis has suffered because of lack of published recommendations for equipment validation and testing requirements, although a validation guideline was published to address this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Guideline recommendations for quantitative image analysis of biomarkers are underway by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). Methods are currently highly variable for these reasons.</p><p>Other reports have highlighted the extent of variability in ER and PR assay results caused by a variety of factors. Results can vary substantially between laboratories because of differences in specimen handling, tissue fixation, antigen retrieval, and antibody type. Depending on the epitope recognized, different antibodies may only detect certain forms of the receptor, such as ER-alpha or ER-beta, and may fail to detect a specific form or variant. In addition, interpretation of assay results is variable due to the variable threshold values for positive and negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/12,31,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,31,44-46</a>]. These variations have resulted in serious issues with ER reliability prior to the development of a national guideline. (See <a href=\"#H12694047\" class=\"local\">'Guideline recommendations to improve ER and PR testing accuracy'</a> below.)</p><p>Assay testing issues have been highlighted in other parts of the world. For example, several Canadian studies demonstrated variations in policies and practices related to ER testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. In addition, older studies from Asia reported that breast cancer was mostly ER negative. However, the percentage of ER-positive tumors in a series of 1000 patients from the Philippines was 68.9 percent after changes in fixation were instituted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].<strong> </strong>In other series from Vietnam and China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], and Nigeria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], over two-thirds of patients had exhibited ER and PR-positive disease after implementation of standardized practices for procurement and formalin fixation of breast cancer specimens for hormone receptor assays.</p><p>Reports from large multinational cooperative groups have addressed concordance between ER testing at the primary institutional site of patient enrollment and centrally by high-volume, academic laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/11,27,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,27,52</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Breast Cancer Intergroup trial Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2197, 11 percent of local ER-negative tests were scored positive upon central testing, for an overall concordance rate for ER of approximately 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ER and PR assay differences between local versus central reference laboratory testing were addressed in a study examining tumor blocks from almost 5000 patients enrolled from countries worldwide (except the United States and China) in the ongoing Adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lapatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lapatinib</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trastuzumab</a> Treatment Optimization (ALTTO) trial between June 2007 and November 2008 that were submitted for pre-randomization confirmation of HER2 status at the European Institute of Oncology (EIO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The contribution of the warm ischemic interval to this macromolecular degradation is under study.</p><p>Breast resection specimens should be fixed as quickly as possible in an adequate volume of fixative (optimally 10-fold greater than volume of the specimen). The time of tissue collection (defined as the time that the tissue is handed from the surgical field) and the time the tissue is placed in fixative should be recorded in order to document the time to fixation.</p><p>Every effort should be made to transport specimens from the operating room to the pathology laboratory as soon as possible. Ideally, the time from tumor removal to fixation should be kept to one hour or less<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/1,2,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,56</a>].

If the excision specimen was obtained remotely from the grossing laboratory, the sample should be bisected through the tumor and promptly placed in NBF prior to transport. The time of removal of the tumor from the patient and the time to insertion of tumor sample into fixative should be noted by the remote operating suite personnel.</p><p>Studies have examined the effect of delays in tissue processing on ER negativity rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In this retrospective multicenter study of 5000 patients treated within the Intermountain Healthcare hospital system, all analytical and reporting considerations were done in a single location. The rates of ER negativity were significantly different and varied with both the site of tumor removal and the days on which surgery was performed. For patients having tumor resections on Monday through Thursday at any site, rates of ER negativity were significantly lower than for those who had surgery on Friday or Saturday. This strongly suggested that specimen handling issues (in particular, prolonged specimen handling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76536\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76536 \">figure 1</a>)) were at fault. &#160;</p><p>Intermountain Healthcare conducted a follow-up study where times of tissue removal and time to fixation (cold ischemic time) were standardized and recorded by two of the six sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. For the two sites, the average time to fixative was 18 minutes, and the average time in fixative was 18 hours. In this cohort, there was a lower prevalence of ER and PR negativity as compared with the four facilities that lacked standardized preanalytical specimen handling conditions, although only the difference in PR negativity rate (24 versus 30 percent) was statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12694167\"><span class=\"h3\">Fixative type and duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only 10 percent NBF should be used as the fixative for breast tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. If a laboratory uses a formalin alternative for fixation, the assay must first be validated against NBF fixation.</p><p>Breast tissue specimens (including core needle biopsies) must be fixed in 10 percent NBF for no less than six hours and not more than 72 hours before processing. The 2013 <span class=\"nowrap\">ASCO/CAP</span> guideline update for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing has now reconciled the fixation time required for ER, PR, and HER2 testing so that any specimen for these testing procedures should be fixed 6 to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Formalin penetrates tissue at a rate of approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour,</span> which is the reason why breast excision samples must be incised in a timely fashion to initiate formalin fixation throughout the tissue. Fixation does not begin until formaldehyde has penetrated into the tissue. However, permeation of tissue by formalin is not the same as the chemical reaction of fixation, which involves protein cross-linking by formaldehyde. Underfixation of breast tissue may lead to false-negative ER results. Overfixation is likely to be less problematic than underfixation, but could also potentially lead to false-negative results due to excessive protein cross-linking by formaldehyde [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/59,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12694226\"><span class=\"h3\">Analysis of ER and PR expression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for ER and PR by IHC must be performed using antibodies that have proven reliable in predicting patient outcome of endocrine treatment. A list of antibodies with acceptable clinical validation was provided in the guideline document [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], but any antibody that has been shown to predict endocrine therapy responses in published reports can be used for these assays.</p><p>Testing for ER and PR must be validated by each laboratory in a set of samples (40 to 80) that are compared with another laboratory using the same antibody method and threshold value for interpretation. Concordance of the results must be 95 percent for positive samples and 90 percent for ER- or PR-negative samples before the laboratory can begin performing the testing on patient samples. The testing method must also involve both positive and negative assay controls that are run concurrent with every clinical specimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12694235\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of ER and PR tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The threshold for a positive result for hormone receptor expression was carefully considered by the guideline panel and is currently established as at least 1 percent of cancer cells staining for ER or PR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Importantly, ER and PR staining does not determine a diagnosis of malignancy, but rather dictates whether cancer cells (identified on the basis of morphology and evidence of invasion) are described as hormone receptor-positive. Previous cutoffs for ER and PR positivity by IHC ranged from 10 to 20 percent staining of cancer cells. IHC testing results of at least 1 percent positive-staining carcinoma cells (for either ER or PR) are associated with significant clinical response to endocrine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/8,11,14,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,14,63-65</a>]. The panel readily acknowledged, however, that there are only low quality data to support such low thresholds and that the reports have suffered from insufficient numbers of patients, which limited statistical power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/63,66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,66-69</a>]. Therefore, if a patient whose cancer demonstrates 1 to 10 percent of staining cells has poor tolerance of endocrine therapy, it is reasonable to consider discontinuation. By contrast, patients whose cancers demonstrate greater than 10 percent staining should be urged to continue endocrine therapy if at all possible due to strong evidence of beneficial effects.</p><p>Practically, this means that all patients with ER or PR expression &gt;1 percent should be offered endocrine therapy. However, if patients with ER expression between 2 and 9 percent do not tolerate treatment for whatever reason, it may be reasonable to discontinue therapy. The administration of endocrine therapy for adjuvant and metastatic breast cancers is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-endocrine-therapy-for-non-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant endocrine therapy for non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-approach-to-metastatic-hormone-receptor-positive-her2-negative-breast-cancer-endocrine-therapy-and-targeted-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment approach to metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer: Endocrine therapy and targeted agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>ER and PR tests should only be evaluated by a pathologist after assuring that the test has been done properly. This is done by reviewing the status of the external controls and also reviewing the status of internal controls for each breast cancer sample. Normal breast epithelium is usually ER- and PR-positive with at least 10 percent of cells expressing these receptors and therefore serve as a positive control for hormone receptor staining.</p><p>Review of internal controls is critical for proper interpretation because it assures that if present, the ER and PR receptors can be correctly identified in the tissue being examined. The entire sample of tumor cells is then carefully examined, and the percent of tumor cells expressing ER or PR receptor in the nuclei of the cells is recorded along with an assessment of the strength of the receptor staining (weak, moderate, strong, 1-3+).</p><p>When IHC assays replaced ligand binding assays (LBAs) in the early-to-mid 1990s, relatively few clinical studies had been performed to establish optimum cut points for either assay. Instead, most studies simply compared the two and assumed that the IHC level that corresponded to the previously determined LBA cut point was also valid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56559 \">table 1</a>). IHC appears to be equivalent or superior to LBA in predicting response to endocrine therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12694341\"><span class=\"h2\">Reporting results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reporting elements that should be included are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78069\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78069 \">table 3</a>).<strong> </strong>The percentage of tumor cells, intensity of tumor cell staining, and the interpretation of the test as positive or negative should be provided. Tumors exhibiting less than 1 percent of tumor cells staining for ER or PR of any intensity should be considered negative based upon data that such patients do not derive meaningful benefit from endocrine therapy.</p><p>The sample should only be considered negative in the presence of appropriately stained extrinsic and intrinsic controls (see below). Any specimen that is negative by ER <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PR IHC assay but lacks intrinsic elements (normal breast epithelium) should be reported as un-interpretable rather than negative. The assay should be repeated using another tumor block or specimen. The pathologist must always take specimen handling issues into consideration and correlate the results of the ER and PR assay with the histologic appearance of the tumor (eg, almost all grade 1 [low grade] breast cancers are ER and PR positive). Results that conflict with clinical considerations should be discussed and perhaps repeated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12694355\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory quality assurance monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The guideline is based on regulatory requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA 88), as well as published studies of the experience of CAP and other groups, and expert panel consensus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/44,70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,70-72</a>].</p><p>ER and PR testing should be performed in a CAP-accredited laboratory or in a laboratory that meets the additional accreditation requirements as set out within the guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormone-receptors-in-breast-cancer-clinical-utility-and-guideline-recommendations-to-improve-test-accuracy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. While mandatory proficiency testing has been a component of laboratory accreditation in Australia and New Zealand since 2001, there are no regulatory requirements for proficiency testing of ER or PR assays in the United States in order for laboratories to be accredited by CLIA. However, the current guideline makes successful performance in proficiency testing mandatory for accreditation. The CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program will monitor performance in the required proficiency testing. Competency of the laboratory personnel performing the <span class=\"nowrap\">ER/PR</span> testing, including the pathologists, is an important aspect of the laboratory proficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assay for tumor expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) have established utility in the clinical management of patients with both early-stage and advanced breast cancer, and they should be routinely obtained on all tumor specimens.
