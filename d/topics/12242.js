Although the antimicrobial treatment of all SFG infections is similar, important differences exist in the epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnostic methods of individual diseases caused by SFG rickettsiae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76555\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76555 \">table 2</a>). Millions of people now travel annually between continents and countries, and physicians who practice in areas far removed from the site of primary infection may face returning travelers with unusual or unfamiliar clinical illnesses that are due to SFG rickettsiae.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment of infections due to SFG organisms other than <em>Rickettsia rickettsii</em> will be reviewed here.

However, there are enough similarities among the diseases caused by SFG rickettsiae that certain clinical and epidemiologic features should suggest their presence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All SFG rickettsial infections cause fever, headache, and intense myalgias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All SFG rickettsial infections are arthropod-borne; known or potential exposure to ticks or mites is an important clue to their early diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rash <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a localized eschar (tache noire) occur in most, but not every, patient infected with SFG rickettsiae.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TAXONOMY AND BASIC BIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae have two major surface-exposed proteins (outer membrane proteins A and B) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-of-rickettsia-rickettsii-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology of Rickettsia rickettsii infection&quot;</a>). Species and strain-specific epitopes are located on these proteins. All SFG rickettsiae grow in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells.</p><p>The taxonomy of rickettsiae remains an area of controversy, and even the definition of what constitutes a rickettsial species is currently debated by biologists with an interest in taxonomy. The genomic differences of recognized species such as <em>Rickettsia conorii</em>, <em>R. sibirica</em>, <em>R. africae</em>, and <em>R. parkeri</em> varies by &lt;0.2 percent. Such a minor degree of genetic variation would actually qualify them for status as strains or subspecies if they were newly identified in other genera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At present, the genomes of 23 of the known 26 <em>Rickettsia</em> species have been sequenced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The discussion of SFG rickettsiae that follows is based upon the current consensus taxonomic schema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The naming of species of SFG is complex, and that complexity continues to increase. For example, some taxonomists have proposed dividing the species <em>R. conorii</em> into 4 subspecies: <em>R. conorii</em> (also known as the Malish strain), <em>R. conorii caspia</em> (previously known as the agent of Astrakanan fever), <em>R. conorii israelensis</em>, and <em>R. conorii indica</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similarly, some investigators have proposed that <em>R. sibirica</em> and <em>R. mongolitimonae</em> should be reclassified as subspecies of <em>R. sibirica</em> (ie, as <em>R. sibirica</em> and <em>R. sibirica mongolitimonae</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, other experts have resisted these proposals until criteria developed by the Internal Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria are met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>It is likely that the present nomenclature will change when future advances in molecular biology occur, new organisms are discovered, and new isolates of known SFG rickettsiae are made from humans and arthropods. As examples, two new SFG rickettsiae have been isolated from <em>Ixodes ricinus</em> ticks in Slovakia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], two SFG rickettsial isolates related to <em>R. japonica</em> have been identified in ticks in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and a new rickettsial species (<em>R. felis</em>) has been isolated from cat fleas in the western United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Approximately one-half of the known species of SFG rickettsiae cause human disease. The remaining organisms are non-pathogenic parasites of arthropods. It is likely that some &quot;nonpathogenic&quot; SFG rickettsiae will eventually be found to cause disease in humans. As an example, <em>R. massiliae</em> is known to cause mild to moderately severe infections in dogs in California even though it has not been proven to cause illness in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, <em>R. montanensis</em>, which has long been considered a nonpathogenic SFG rickettsiae, was recently implicated as the cause of mild illness in a young child with a skin rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The literature on SFG rickettsiae is often confusing because clinical manifestations of illness due to one species may vary from region to region and host to host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, one patient with Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) may have a mild disease while another may have severe, or even fatal, illness.</p><p>The determinants of these variations in virulence remain poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Animal models suggest that dendritic cells may play an important role in augmentation of an adaptive Th1 cellular immune response against rickettsial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Dendritic cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that lead to natural killer (NK) cell activation and proliferation; expansion of this cellular compartment correlated with protection from lethal rickettsial challenge in a murine model.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SFG rickettsial diseases are transmitted by ticks with two exceptions: rickettsialpox is transmitted by mites, and <em>R. felis</em> is transmitted by cat fleas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rickettsialpox</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rickettsialpox was first described in New York City, but cases have also been reported from the Ukraine, Korea, and Slovenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Rickettsialpox is caused by <em>Rickettsia akari</em> and is transmitted by the bite of the house mouse mite (<em>Allodermanyssus sanguineous</em>). Humans are typically bitten by mouse mites after mouse extermination programs result in starving mites that seek alternative sources for a blood meal. The principal reservoir of <em>R. akari</em> is the house mouse, but transovarial infection by <em>R. akari</em> occurs in infected mites; thus, mites may be considered both the vector and a reservoir of rickettsialpox.</p><p>Seven to ten days after a mite bite, a painless red papule typically appears at the site of the inoculation. Fever characteristically begins no more than 24 hours before the development of rash. This pattern was observed in 100 percent of 13 patients in one small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This papule then becomes vesicular over the next several days and eventually crusts, producing an eschar. The crusts may be small and easily overlooked unless the skin is examined with care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Regional lymphadenopathy often accompanies the inoculation lesion.</p><p>Patients typically develop fever, chills, myalgia, and headache at the same time as the papule or early eschar appears. A generalized rash can occur simultaneously with the primary inoculation lesion or follow its appearance by several days. This rash is typically maculopapular, but individual lesions frequently become vesicular. In cases in which a vesicular rash is prominent, a misdiagnosis of varicella may be made. Vesicular lesions normally develop crusts as they heal, but these lesions, unlike chickenpox, do not produce scars. Rickettsialpox is usually a mild self-limiting illness even without treatment, but symptoms may last three weeks if treatment is not administered early in the course of illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mediterranean spotted fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), also known as boutonneuse fever, is caused by <em>R. conorii</em>. <em>R. conorii</em> infection occurs in countries and regions adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea as well as in sub-Saharan Africa, Greece, India, and in areas around the Black Sea, such as Turkey, Bulgaria, and Ukraine. Sporadic cases have been described in non-endemic regions either in travelers or in patients who had contact with dogs infected from endemic areas. </p><p>Similar to RMSF, the onset of MSF is typically abrupt. Almost all patients have fever, headache, and a rash. In two large series of MSF from Southern Europe, rash was present in 97 and 99 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. However, the rash is often absent during the first few days of illness as in other rickettsial diseases. The rash is most often maculopapular, but is petechial in approximately 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Unlike RMSF, many patients with MSF have an eschar or black necrotic scabbed lesion (tache noire) at the site of the inoculating tick bite; in two large series, a tache noire was present in approximately 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. Rarely, multiple eschars are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A papulovesicular or vesicular rash is uncommon in patients with MSF, but when vesicles occur, the illness may be mistaken for varicella.</p><p>MSF may follow a less severe clinical course than RMSF. In a review of 199 documented cases, for example, there were only three deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the number of admissions for MSF tripled from 1994 to 2004 in Portugal. In a prospective study of risk factors associated with mortality among 140 hospitalized Portuguese patients with documented MSF, death occurred in 21 percent of patients. Patients who were infected with the Israel spotted fever strain (also known as <em>R. conorii israelensis</em>) had significantly higher case fatality ratios than patients infected with the Malish strain (ie, 29 versus 9 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients with severe infections may have neurologic, cardiac, ocular, or renal complications. The hemophagocytic syndrome has also been described in patients infected with <em>R. conorii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/2,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Queensland tick typhus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Queensland tick typhus (QTT) is caused by <em>Rickettsia australis</em> and occurs along the entire east coast of Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. QTT is typically a mild disease, although one fatal case has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. QTT is primarily transmitted by the scrub tick (<em>lxodes holocyclus</em>) and the organism circulates in nature between ticks, rodents, and small marsupials. As in other SFG rickettsial infections, man is only incidentally infected.</p><p>An eschar occurs in one-half to two-thirds of infected patients at the site of the tick bite. Regional lymphadenopathy often occurs in adjacent nodal regions. The skin rash in patients with QTT may be maculopapular, petechial, or vesicular. When a vesicular rash is present, the illness may be confused with chickenpox, which, as noted above, can also occur with rickettsialpox or MSF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Flinders Island spotted fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flinders Island spotted fever was first recognized by an Australian general practitioner in the 1980s in patients living on a remote island in the Bass Straits between Tasmania and the Australian mainland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The causative agent, <em>R. honei</em>, is genotypically distinct from the agent of QTT (<em>R. australis</em>), although the clinical manifestations of the diseases produced by the two organisms are almost indistinguishable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Some cases of Flinders Island spotted fever have been caused by a strain that is genetically related to <em>R. honei</em> and has been designated the marmionii strain of <em>R. honei</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p><em>R. honei</em> has also been identified in other parts of the world. As examples, <em>R. honei</em> detected in a clinical specimen from a patient in Thailand may be responsible for a spotted fever group rickettsiosis formerly known as Thai tick typhus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], and a case of severe illness due to <em>R. honei</em> was described in a patient in Nepal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Flinders Island spotted fever is usually a mild disease. Approximately one-fourth of patients have a necrotic inoculation lesion, one-half have localized lymphadenopathy, and virtually all patients have fever, headache, and myalgias. Skin rash is usually maculopapular but rarely may be petechial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">African tick bite fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although recognized as a distinct clinical illness in the 1930s and shown to be caused by a unique SFG rickettsiae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], African tick bite fever (ATBF) was later erroneously attributed to <em>R. conorii</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Almost 60 years later, an isolate of a SFG rickettsiae was made from <em>Amblyomma hebraeum</em> ticks in Zimbabwe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This isolate was shown to be genotypically distinct from <em>R. conorii</em> and was named <em>R. africae</em>. Subsequently, identical isolations have been made from humans. This organism is now assumed to be the same organism isolated decades earlier.</p><p><em>R. africae</em> is the cause of ATBF, a distinct illness with these characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild clinical illness with headache, fever, and myalgias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solitary or multiple eschars associated with regional lymphadenopathy, which are common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53029\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53029 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A scant generalized rash that may be vesicular or maculopapular.

An outbreak in 13 French participants in an adventure race in South Africa illustrated that travelers to endemic regions can easily acquire infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This infection may be fairly common in returning travelers from Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As an example, in another series of 120 travelers with tick bite-related disease, 117 of whom had traveled to Africa, all but one of the patients had <em>R. africae</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. ATBF is also endemic to the eastern Caribbean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">R. sibirica infection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Siberian tick typhus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Siberian tick typhus, caused by <em>R. sibirica</em>, was first recognized in Siberia during the 1930s. <em>R. sibirica</em> infection is now known to occur throughout much of northern and central Asia from Pakistan to northern China. Acute infection was reported in 4 of 13 paleontologists during an expedition to Mongolia; only two of the four recognized that they had been bitten by a tick [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Similar to <em>R. rickettsii</em> infection, patients with Siberian tick typhus typically develop rash, fever, and headache four to seven days after a tick bite. <em>R. sibirica</em> infection commonly causes an eschar at the inoculation site of the infecting tick bite and is rarely associated with serious complications or death, even if untreated. These characteristics are similar to <em>R. conorii</em> infection, but not RMSF. Patients frequently have regional lymphadenopathy near the site of their ulcerated or necrotic inoculation lesion. Skin rash, which may be maculopapular, petechial, or purpuric, typically appears two to four days after the onset of fever and other systemic symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1122831841\"><span class=\"h3\">Rickettsia heilongjangensis infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Far-Eastern spotted fever (FESF) caused by <em>R. heilongjangensis</em> produces an illness similar to Siberian tick typhus in the Russian Far East and China. Illness due to this pathogen was distinguished from illness due to <em>R. siberica</em> using molecular methods, and is most common in endemic regions during the late summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">R. sibirica subspecies mongolotimonae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>R. sibirica</em> subspecies mongolotimonae was first isolated from a tick in Inner Mongolia in 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Most of the recognized cases of infection with <em>R. sibirica</em> subspecies mongolitimonae have occurred in patients from southern France. However, cases have also been reported from Greece, Portugal, and South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Illness due to this pathogen has been called &quot;lymphangitis-associated rickettsiosis&quot; because it frequently presents with enlarged regional lymph nodes or lymphangitis. In addition to lymphadenopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphangitis, clinical manifestations often include fever, maculopapular rash, and one or more inoculation eschars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Some patients may develop severe illness with complications such as acute renal failure, retinal vasculitis, and mental status changes. However, no fatalities have been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Japanese spotted fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First described in 1984, Japanese spotted fever (JSF) has been confined mainly to southwest Japan, with one reported case in Thailand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Several species of <em>Dermacentor</em>, <em>Haemaphysalis</em>, and <em>lxodes</em> ticks have been shown to transmit <em>R. japonica</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>JSF is caused by <em>R. japonica</em> and produces an illness very similar to MSF.

Although no confirmed cases of <em>R. parkeri</em> have been documented in this geographic area, a traveler returning from Honduras was shown to have <em>R. parkeri</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>The largest case series to date examined clinical specimens from patients in the United States who had a history of an eschar or vesicular rash and resided within the range of <em>A. maculatum</em> (ie, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Laboratory diagnostic methods included at least one or more of the following: indirect immunofluorescence assays, histology, immunohistochemistry, cell culture (ie, Vero cells), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Six confirmed and six probable cases of <em>R. parkeri</em> rickettsiosis were identified from patients with possible rickettsial illness who were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1998 to 2007. The majority of the patients became ill between late July and early September. Seven of 12 reported a history of a tick bite with resultant eschar formation. </p><p>Another five cases were subsequently identified at a single site in Georgia from 2012 to 2014, four of which were PCR-positive for <em>R. parkeri </em>in eschar biopsy samples using polymerase chain reaction testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Antibodies generated to antigens of <em>R. parkeri</em> can react with <em>R. rickettsii</em>, <em>R. akari</em>, and other SFGR infections. Not only does this lead to diagnostic uncertainty, but epidemiologic trends of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) may be clouded by a blending of other less severe rickettsial diseases. </p><p><em>R. parkeri</em> rickettsiosis tends to be a milder illness than RMSF, which can lead to hospitalization, coma, and death if untreated. Helpful clinical features that distinguish <em>R. parkeri</em> rickettsiosis from RMSF include the presence of an eschar or a vesicular or pustular rash. The relative absence of gastrointestinal systems would also suggest <em>R. parkeri</em> rickettsiosis since nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are commonly seen in RMSF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1641290622\"><span class=\"h2\">R. amblyommii infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are preliminary and still inconclusive data that suggest <em>R. amblyommii</em> may produce a mild infection in humans.

This species had been described previously, but was not known to cause human illness. The organism is thought to be transmitted by <em>Dermacentor occidentalis</em> ticks. Most cases have been reported in children or the elderly, and have presented as a mild illness characterized by eschar formation, mild headache, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fevers. This milder disease, along with the prevalence of <em>R. philipii</em> in <em>D. occidentalis</em> ticks in California (reported as high as 7 percent), suggest this illness may be more common than is recognized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with patients with RMSF, the diagnosis of SFG rickettsial infections is usually based upon clinical features and epidemiologic clues (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;</a>). The presence of a characteristic rash in a febrile patient is usually the first tip-off to a diagnosis of SFG rickettsial disease. Similar to RMSF, confirmation of a clinical diagnosis can be achieved in four basic ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolation of rickettsiae</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunologic detection of rickettsiae in tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCR amplification of rickettsial DNA</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolation of rickettsiae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individual species of SFG rickettsiae can be isolated following inoculation into animals, such as guinea pigs, rats or moles, or into embryonated eggs. Cell culture methods, including shell vial assay with early antigen detection by immunofluorescence, can also identify rickettsiae within 48 to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/12,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,66</a>]. All isolation methods require specialized laboratory facilities with appropriate safety systems designed to prevent laboratory acquisition of human infection. Such facilities and specialized reagents are available in only a few research centers; thus, isolation of rickettsiae is rare in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic detection of convalescent antibodies is the mainstay of diagnosis of SFG rickettsial infection. The following serologic tests can be used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weil Felix (WF) agglutination test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microimmunofluorescent (MIF) antibody test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Western blot immunoassay</p><p/><p>The WF test is neither specific nor sensitive; thus, most experts advise that its routine use be abandoned. MIF, ELISA, and Western blot immunoassay methods detect convalescent IgM and IgG antibodies 10 to 14 days after the onset of illness. These methods usually are not useful in the initial clinical management of patients with acute illness. Moreover, since serologic cross-reactions commonly occur among SFG species, none of these methods can reliably distinguish between species of SFG rickettsiae. However, a modification of the ELISA test, utilizing epitope saturation by specific monoclonal antibodies, has been developed to serologically confirm the specific species of infective rickettsiae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic detection of rickettsia in tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsies of skin rash, an eschar, or other tissues can be useful in the diagnosis of all SFG rickettsiae. However, such biopsies are rarely performed because specialized laboratory facilities needed to stain and process such tissues are not commonly available in areas where these diseases are endemic. Samples of tissue can be examined fresh (by frozen section) or after fixation in paraffin embedding. The tache noire lesion present in many SFG infections often contains large numbers of rickettsiae. Tissues can be stained with fluorescent-tagged conjugates or by immunoperoxidase staining.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">PCR-based detection of rickettsia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from blood, skin biopsy samples, and other tissues can be performed for detection of rickettsial DNA. Due to the pathophysiology of rickettsial infections, PCR of tissue samples typically offers much higher sensitivity than PCR of whole blood. Detection of rickettsial DNA is based upon recognition of sequences within the genes encoding 16S rRNA, a 17 kDa protein, citrate synthase (gltA), or ompA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>A new technique called &quot;suicide PCR&quot; uses primers from rickettsial genes in the genomes of <em>R. conorii</em> and <em>Rickettsia prowazekii</em> and is able to detect rickettsiae in skin biopsy specimens from patients with a variety of spotted fever group rickettsioses. In one report, this technique was able to detect rickettsial DNA in skin biopsy specimens from patients with <em>R. conorii</em>, <em>R. africae</em>, and <em>R. sibirica</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Using a large cohort of patients with infection and corresponding controls, the estimated sensitivity and specificity were 68 and 100 percent, respectively. Suicide PCR was estimated to be 2.2 times more sensitive than culture and 1.5 times more sensitive than regular PCR techniques.</p><p>At present, quantitative real-time PCR methods are rarely used outside of research centers.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-murine-typhus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of murine typhus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scrub-typhus-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scrub typhus: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28326361\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Rickettsia</em> of the Spotted Fever Group (SFG), a class of arthropod-transmitted diseases, cause human disease on six continents. Regardless of species, infection with one of these <em>Rickettsia</em> leads to fever, headache, and intense myalgias, often in association with a rash or localized eschar. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Species and strain-specific epitopes are located within two major outer membrane proteins. All SFG rickettsiae grow in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells. Approximately half of the known species of SFG rickettsiae cause human disease while the remaining organisms are non-pathogenic parasites of arthropods. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Taxonomy and basic biology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The various clinical illnesses that are seen in association with the individual <em>Rickettsia</em> vary significantly in severity. The determinants of virulence remain poorly understood. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SFG rickettsial diseases are transmitted by ticks with two notable exceptions: Rickettsialpox is transmitted by mites, and <em>Rickettsia felis</em> is transmitted by cat fleas. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Specific infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a characteristic rash in a febrile patient is usually the first clue to a diagnosis of SFG rickettsial disease. Similar to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, confirmation of a clinical diagnosis can be achieved in four basic ways: isolation of the organism, serology, polymerase chain reaction detection of DNA, and immunologic detection in tissue samples. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, the preferred treatment of all SFG rickettsial infections is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>. The route of administration will depend upon the severity of disease, but most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Walker DH.
