The syndrome is appropriately termed venous thoracic outlet syndrome but is also referred to as Paget-Schroetter syndrome, and alternatively as &quot;effort&quot; thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It typically presents in young, otherwise healthy individuals as sudden, severe upper extremity pain and swelling following vigorous upper extremity activity. An aggressive treatment approach that includes anticoagulation, catheter-directed thrombolysis, and thoracic outlet decompression is aimed at relieving acute symptoms and minimizing complications, including recurrent thromboembolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. The presentation and diagnosis of primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis in children is similar to that of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of primary (spontaneous) upper extremity venous thrombosis will be reviewed here. Catheter-induced upper extremity venous thrombosis and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis are discussed elsewhere.

Compression of the venous structures that traverse the thoracic outlet occurs in two distinct spaces: the scalene triangle and the costoclavicular space.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scalene triangle &ndash; The anterior border of the scalene triangle is formed by the anterior scalene muscle, which originates from the transverse processes of the third through sixth cervical vertebrae (C3-C6) and inserts on the inner borders and superior surfaces of the first rib. The posterior wall of the scalene triangle is formed by the middle scalene muscle, which arises from the transverse processes of the second through seventh cervical vertebrae (C2-C7) and inserts broadly onto the posterior aspects of the first rib. The superior border of the first rib forms the base of the scalene triangle. The trunks of the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery pass between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, while the subclavian vein courses anteromedial to the scalene triangle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50430\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50430 \">figure 3B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Costoclavicular space &ndash; The costoclavicular space comprises the area between the first rib and the clavicle.

Primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis is a manifestation of venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thoracic-outlet-syndromes#H455545401\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thoracic outlet syndromes&quot;, section on 'Venous TOS'</a>.)</p><p>Thrombosis of the veins draining the upper extremity was originally postulated to be the cause of acute arm pain and swelling by Paget [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and later Von Schroetter related the clinical syndrome specifically to the axillary and subclavian veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This clinical entity was referred to as Paget-Schroetter syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the mid-20th century, the term &quot;effort&quot; thrombosis was coined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], due to the fact that the syndrome often occurred in physically active individuals after unusually strenuous use of the arm and shoulder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The term &quot;spontaneous&quot; upper extremity venous thrombosis has also been used, highlighting the often dramatic presentation in an otherwise healthy, young individual. For the purposes of our discussion, we will refer to the syndrome as primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis to distinguish it from secondary causes, which are associated with inciting factors such as indwelling catheters or prothrombotic states. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anatomic abnormalities of the thoracic outlet that result in compression of the vein can be congenital or acquired. Congenital anomalies consist of cervical ribs, supernumerary muscles, abnormal tendon insertions, or abnormal muscular or tendinous bands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Acquired abnormalities include bony overgrowth due to bony fracture (eg, clavicle, first rib) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>], or hypertrophy of anterior scalene muscle or subclavius muscles, often related to repetitive lifting. The abnormalities of the thoracic outlet are often bilateral, and bilateral primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Anatomic abnormalities often narrow the costoclavicular space, predisposing the vein to compression between the first rib and muscle or tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59433%7ESURG%2F50430\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59433 graphicRef50430 \">figure 3A-B</a>), or between anomalous tendon insertions. Less commonly, compression of the vein between the clavicle and a cervical rib can occur. Partial occlusion of the vein by a congenital web has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H186006964\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic outlet anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p>Under some circumstances, it appears that an anatomic abnormality is not necessary to produce injury to the vein. Extremes in range of motion of the upper extremity can lead to movement of the clavicle relative to the first rib sufficient to cause venous compression. Repetitive overhead arm movements or hyperabduction and external rotation of the shoulder are most often implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Repetitive injury causes perivenous fibrosis, which eventually leads to thrombosis. It is important to recognize that the patient often presents with acute onset of symptoms related to the thrombosis, but the underlining problem may be a chronic repetitive injury that had narrowed the vein.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239061271\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (all causes) represents 1 to 4 percent of all cases of deep vein thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis is rare with an estimated annual incidence of 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/11,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25</a>]. The majority of cases of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis are secondary and related to central venous cannulation (eg, central line, pacemaker) or prothrombotic states (eg, thrombophilia, malignancy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1,11,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,26,27</a>]. Primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis has also been reported in children, typically adolescents, with clinical presentations that are similar to those of adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Between 60 and 80 percent of patients with primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis report a history of exercise or strenuous activity involving usually the dominant upper extremity prior to the onset of symptoms. Strenuous activities include weight-lifting, rowing, or activities involving repetitive overhead arm movements, particularly hyperabduction, such as pitching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28,29</a>]. The average age at presentation is in the early thirties, and the male to female ratio is 2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A predominance of right-handed individuals may explain why the right axillosubclavian vein is more commonly affected.

In the pediatric population, primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis presents with similar symptoms and thrombotic complications as with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/2,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,34,35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351070\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute presentations are due to sudden thrombosis of the axillosubclavian vein. The classic presentation is that of a young, athletic male presenting with acute onset of upper extremity pain and swelling in the dominant arm following a particularly strenuous activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28,29</a>]. Strenuous use of the arm prior to the onset of extremity swelling or pain is recalled in 40 to 80 percent of patients, and symptoms are generally noticed within 24 hours of the strenuous activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/11,12,24,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,24,36</a>]. The majority of patients (70 to 80 percent) manifest with variable degrees of neck, shoulder, or axillary discomfort; arm heaviness; and pain associated with complaints of upper extremity swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Swelling and pain typically improve with rest and elevation of the arm to the level of the heart, whereas elevation of the extremity overhead may aggravate the symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Physical examination generally reveals edema of the affected extremity, often accompanied by cyanosis of the hand and fingers. The patient may also have a low-grade fever. A palpable venous cord (superficial thrombophlebitis) may be apparent in associated superficial veins (eg, proximal cephalic vein). Dilated subcutaneous collateral veins, also known as Urschel's sign, may be noticeable over the upper chest and proximal upper extremity, particularly in those with an underlying chronic venous stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/12,28,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28,37</a>]. </p><p>The upper extremity arterial vascular examination should be normal. Reduced arterial blood flow due to venous congestion (phlegmasia cerulea dolens) is rare in the lower extremity and even more so in the upper extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. However, if present, it represents an emergency and indicates the need for emergent treatment. (See <a href=\"#H185996469\" class=\"local\">'Thrombolytic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Coexistent signs related to brachial plexus compression (ie, neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome) may be present, manifesting as paraesthesias or pain in the ulnar nerve distribution, tenderness over the supraclavicular fossa, and wasting of the intrinsic hand muscles.

If venous occlusion develops over a protracted period of time, edema or pain may be minimal, and increased venous collateral flow over the chest (Urschel's sign) may be the only clinical sign that is apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/12,28,37,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28,37,47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185997417\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of upper extremity venous outflow obstruction (ie, deep vein thrombosis or venous stenosis) may be suspected based upon the clinical presentation but should be confirmed with imaging, typically initially using ultrasound. D-dimer is useful for excluding thrombosis as an etiology but will not exclude venous stenosis without thrombosis as a source of symptoms. For the patient who presents with the classic presentation, once a diagnosis of venous outflow obstruction is established, no further workup is necessary except a plain chest radiograph to identify any obvious bony abnormalities prior to intervention. In the absence of an obvious bony anatomic abnormality, the specific anatomic abnormality may not be determined until the time of surgical exploration. (See <a href=\"#H239066343\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Advanced venous imaging may be needed to demonstrate abnormal venous compression when there is a diagnostic dilemma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1387789930\"><span class=\"h2\">D-dimer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma D-dimer, which is a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin, may be elevated in patients with upper extremity deep vein thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], as in those with other lower extremity deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. However, although a plasma D-dimer &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> is sensitive for thrombosis and has a high negative predictive value, it is not specific for the anatomic location of the thrombosis and will not exclude vein <span class=\"nowrap\">compression/stenosis</span> as a source for symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239062098\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>B-mode ultrasound, color Doppler ultrasound, and duplex ultrasound have been used extensively in the diagnosis of deep vein obstruction. Noncompressibility of the vein on B-mode ultrasound with or without visible intraluminal thrombus is the major criterion for the diagnosis of venous thrombosis. We use duplex ultrasound as the initial test for diagnosing upper extremity venous outflow obstruction because it is noninvasive, inexpensive, and, in observational studies, has an acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/38,50-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,50-57</a>]. A systematic review evaluated 17 studies, concluding that compression ultrasonography is an acceptable alternative to standard contrast venography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The summary estimates of the sensitivity of compression, Doppler ultrasound, and Doppler ultrasound with compression were 97, 84, and 81 percent, respectively, and specificities were 96, 94, and 93 percent, respectively. Disadvantages of ultrasound are that it is technician dependent and that nonocclusive mural thrombus and thrombus in the proximal subclavian or innominate veins may not be adequately seen as a result of acoustic shadowing by the overlying clavicle and sternum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/56,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,58,59</a>]. </p><p>Although standard catheter-based (digital subtraction) venography provides the best definition of abnormal venous anatomy and is the standard with which other modalities are compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/50,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,60</a>], it is generally not needed to solely establish a diagnosis of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis or compression. Because of its invasive nature, catheter-based venography is generally reserved for situations where noninvasive studies are equivocal but clinical suspicion remains high for a primary cause of venous outlet obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For patients with intermittent or chronic symptoms, extrinsic compression of the vein can be demonstrated during catheter-based venography by performing dynamic studies that place the arm in various positions during the study. The venogram may be normal at rest but abnormal (varying degrees of extrinsic compression with &quot;new&quot; venous collaterals) with arm abduction; however, vein compression with arm abduction can be a normal variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>] </p><p>Less invasive methods of venography include computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) venography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/59,62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,62-64</a>]. These modalities are not typically used to establish an initial diagnosis of upper extremity venous outflow obstruction. However, in the situation with atypical symptoms or equivocal ultrasound study, these study modalities offer noninvasive methods to further evaluate central veins and surrounding structures. These studies are also useful for identifying other secondary causes for deep vein thrombosis (eg, tumor). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT venography can be used to confirm or exclude central vein thrombus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F115176\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef115176 \">image 1</a>); however, like catheter-based venography, substantial contrast loads are required. CT venography has not been studied sufficiently to determine its sensitivity and specificity. A small study of 18 patients compared CT venography and digital subtraction venography for their ability to discriminate the severity and extent of venous obstruction, the cause of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, and implications for the planning of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

The clinical features of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis are otherwise similar and include upper extremity edema and pain, and cyanosis of the skin due to venous congestion. Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis that occurs in the absence of instrumentation and with no identifiable anatomic abnormalities or other risk factors for venous thrombosis (eg, oral contraceptives) raises a concern of occult malignancy.

Although early intervention is advocated, patients with primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis who present later than two weeks may also benefit from thoracic outlet decompression (no thrombolysis) given the high rates of recurrent thrombosis and long-term morbidity associated with anticoagulation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/4,23,96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,23,96,97</a>].</p><p>In a worldwide clinical series of 606 patients with primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, early thrombolysis and first rib resection provided the best outcome, with 95 percent of the surgical cohort experiencing an excellent clinical outcome compared with 29 percent treated conservatively, which consisted of anticoagulation, arm elevation, and upper extremity compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Residual venous obstruction was present in 78 percent of patients.

After a mean follow-up of five years, 22 percent had persistent severe venous outflow obstruction on follow-up ultrasound. Approximately 50 percent of the patients were asymptomatic, but 13 percent had severe or disabling symptoms. Subsequent pulmonary embolism was documented in 26 percent and was symptomatic in one-third of the patients. By comparison, among patients treated with thrombolysis (without thoracic outlet decompression), 76 percent were asymptomatic after a mean follow-up of 55 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/22,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,93</a>].

In the retrospective review, 45 of 110 patients underwent preoperative thrombolysis alone or thrombolysis and balloon venoplasty prior to thoracic outlet decompression. The remaining 65 patients were treated with anticoagulation alone prior to thoracic outlet decompression. Up to 80 percent of occluded axillosubclavian veins recanalized during the follow-up period in the anticoagulation group, and the overall rates of venous patency were similar between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1387792888\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations of others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our recommendations are in general agreement with the guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP); however, the ACCP suggests anticoagulant therapy alone over thrombolysis for patients with acute upper extremity deep vein thrombosis that involves the axillary or more proximal veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. They further state that patients are likely to choose thrombolytic therapy over anticoagulation alone if they are more likely to benefit from thrombolysis, have access to catheter-based therapy, attach a high value to the prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome, and attach a lower value to the initial complexity, cost, and risk of bleeding with thrombolytic therapy. This recommendation does not distinguish between primary and secondary causes of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis directly; however, given that patients with primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis are more likely to benefit from thrombolysis compared with patients with secondary causes of deep vein thrombosis, we support a more aggressive treatment strategy.

Anticoagulant therapy is also effective in preventing pulmonary embolism with lower extremity venous thrombosis and, by extrapolation, may also prevent embolism from upper extremity deep vein thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-spontaneous-upper-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis/abstract/29,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,70,71</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis is defined as thrombosis of the deep veins draining the upper extremity (axillary, subclavian) due to an underlying anatomic anomaly at the thoracic outlet causing compression or repetitive venous injury. The syndrome is appropriately termed venous thoracic outlet syndrome but is also referred to as Paget-Schroetter syndrome and &quot;effort&quot; thrombosis. Anatomic abnormalities can be congenital or acquired. Congenital anomalies consist of cervical ribs, supernumerary muscles, abnormal tendon insertions, or abnormal muscular or tendinous bands. Acquired abnormalities include bony overgrowth due to bony fracture (usually of the clavicle), or hypertrophy of anterior scalene muscle or subclavius muscles, often related to repetitive lifting. (See <a href=\"#H239061107\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis typically presents in young, otherwise healthy individuals as sudden, severe arm swelling. Although more commonly associated with lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism from upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (primary and secondary) occurs in 4 to 10 percent of patients. The clinician should have a high index of suspicion for this disorder when a young patient with no inciting factors presents with signs of upper extremity venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism in the absence of lower extremity symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of upper extremity venous outflow obstruction (ie, deep vein thrombosis or venous stenosis) may be suspected based upon the clinical presentation but should be confirmed with imaging, typically initially using ultrasound. D-dimer is useful for excluding thrombosis as an etiology but will not exclude vein <span class=\"nowrap\">compression/stenosis</span> without thrombosis as a source of symptoms. Once a diagnosis of venous outflow obstruction is established, a primary etiology should be sought to identify the underlying anatomic abnormality that is the source of the obstruction. We obtain a plain chest radiograph on all patients to identify any obvious bony abnormalities. More advanced imaging may be necessary to demonstrate abnormal muscular attachments or dynamic venous compression for atypical presentations. (See <a href=\"#H185997417\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis is aimed at preventing pulmonary embolism, recurrent venous thrombosis, and post-thrombotic syndrome. For patients with acutely symptomatic primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, we recommend anticoagulation over no such therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Anticoagulation helps to maintain patency of collateral veins, reduces propagation of thrombus, and is effective for preventing pulmonary embolism.<strong> </strong>We prefer to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> to facilitate rapid dose adjustment in patients who will undergo other interventions such as thrombolysis and thoracic outlet decompression. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with moderate-to-severe acute symptoms who are diagnosed with primary upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, we suggest thrombolysis over anticoagulation alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Following thrombolysis, we suggest thoracic outlet decompression, rather than no decompression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This approach decreases the risk for recurrent thrombosis and post-thrombotic syndrome. Anticoagulation alone may be adequate for minimally symptomatic or intermittently symptomatic patients. For those who present in a delayed manner (&gt;2 weeks from the onset of symptoms), decompression of thoracic outlet in addition to anticoagulation may be beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H239066343\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H352775\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for aggressive treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with American College of Chest Physicians who recommend a minimum of three months of anticoagulation following an initial thrombotic event. We maintain anticoagulation for a minimum of three months regardless of whether intervention (thrombolysis, thoracic outlet decompression) was performed.
