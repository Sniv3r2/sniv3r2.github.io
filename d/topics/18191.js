Catabolism of the nucleic acids to uric acid leads to hyperuricemia; the marked increase in uric acid excretion can result in the precipitation of uric acid in the renal tubules and renal vasoconstriction, impaired autoregulation, decreased renal flow, oxidation, and inflammation, resulting in acute kidney injury. Hyperphosphatemia with calcium phosphate deposition in the renal tubules can also cause acute kidney injury. High concentrations of both uric acid and phosphate potentiate the risk of acute kidney injury because uric acid precipitates more readily in the presence of calcium phosphate and vice versa.

TLS occurred in 130 patients (17 percent), of whom 38 (5 percent) had clinical TLS and 92 (12 percent), laboratory TLS. Clinical (but not laboratory) TLS was associated with a significantly higher risk of death during induction therapy (79 percent [30 of 38 patients] versus 23 percent in those without evidence of clinical TLS).

In addition to an increase in mortality, the development of TLS is also associated with higher rates of treatment-related complications and costs, as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of data from the Health Care Utilization project on 600,000 patients treated for a hematologic malignancy, patients who developed acute renal failure requiring dialysis had a significantly longer hospital stay (21 versus 7 days) and fivefold higher total cost per discharge than did those who did not develop renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a multicenter European analysis of 788 patients undergoing induction treatment for newly diagnosed or recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), AML, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The incremental cost of prevention was divided by the average number of life-years saved to produce the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which represents the estimated cost per life-year saved. For pediatric patients, who have high life expectancies, the ICER per life-year saved ranged from 425 to 3054 Euros, depending upon the country. For adults, the ICER ranged from 23,794 to 41,383 Euros with NHL or ALL to close to 100,000 Euros with AML, largely due to the limited life expectancy of these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective cohort study of administrative data using the Cerner Health Facts database, which captured patient data from more than 400 United States hospitals, clinical and economic outcomes were compared between 26 rasburicase-treated patients and 104 propensity score matched allopurinol-treated controls receiving treatment for cancer between 2005 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasburicase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rasburicase</a> treatment was associated with a significant 5.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> greater reduction in uric acid within two days of treatment initiation (p&lt;0.0001), a shorter length of stay in the intensive care unit (by 2.5 days, p&lt;0.0001), a shorter total length of hospital stay (by five days, p = 0.02), and lower total health care costs per patient per hospitalization (by $20,038, p&lt;0.02) as compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> treatment.</p><p/><p>These data provide support for routine prophylaxis of TLS in patients at intermediate or high risk for this complication.

(See <a href=\"#H21712100\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of established TLS'</a> below.)</p><p>The main prophylactic strategies are intravenous (IV) hydration and the use of hypouricemic agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasburicase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasburicase</a>. The specific type of prophylaxis is generally selected based upon the estimated risk of TLS, which depends on the disease, the disease burden, and the specific treatment to be administered. A risk stratification strategy, along with treatment guidelines, is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57607 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21712044\"><span class=\"h2\">IV hydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggressive IV hydration is the cornerstone of preventing TLS and is recommended prior to therapy in all patients at intermediate or high risk for TLS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57607 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The goal of IV hydration is to improve renal perfusion and glomerular filtration, and induce a high urine output to minimize the likelihood of uric acid or calcium phosphate precipitation in the tubules. However, IV hydration can lead to potentially dangerous fluid overload in patients with underlying acute kidney injury or cardiac dysfunction (particularly if the patient is in an edematous state). In this setting, close monitoring of vital signs and urine output is mandatory, transfusion (if needed) should be given slowly and in low volume, and diuretics can be given to maintain urine output (see below). Monitoring in an intensive care unit (ICU) may be required. Prior to initiation of IV hydration, reversible forms of acute kidney injury (eg, urinary tract obstruction) should be corrected.</p><p>A 2008 International Expert Panel on TLS recommended that both children and adults at risk for TLS initially receive 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day of IV fluid (or 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day in children weighing &le;10 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Urine output should be monitored closely and maintained within a range of 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> per hour (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour for both children and adults, 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour if &le;10 kg). Diuretics can be used to maintain the urine output, if necessary, but should not be required in patients with relatively normal renal and cardiac function. Use of diuretics is contraindicated in patients with hypovolemia or obstructive uropathy. The best diuretic for patients with TLS is unknown; loop diuretics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> appear preferable because they not only induce diuresis, but may also increase potassium secretion.</p><p>The choice of hydration fluid depends upon the clinical circumstances. The expert panel suggests the initial use of 5 percent dextrose one-quarter normal (isotonic) saline, probably because acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients receive steroid during remission induction, which can cause sodium retention and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In patients with hyponatremia or volume depletion, isotonic saline should be the initial hydration fluid. Due to the risk of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia with calcium phosphate precipitation once tumor breakdown begins, potassium and calcium should be withheld from the hydration fluids, at least initially.</p><p>There are no guidelines that address the optimal duration of hydration, which should depend on the tumor burden, the type of chemotherapy used (some regimens induce TLS several days later), the drug sensitivity of the tumor, the patient's ability to drink, and renal function. IV hydration should be continued at least until tumor burden (as indicated by blast cell count as well as liver and spleen size in patients with leukemia, and serum lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] level or tumor size in those with solid tumors) is largely resolved, there is no evidence of significant tumor lysis (as indicated by serum uric acid and phosphorus level), and patient can drink adequately with good urine output.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21712051\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary alkalinization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of urinary alkalinization with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> is unclear and controversial. In the past, alkalinization to a urine pH of 6.5 to 7 or even higher was recommended to increase uric acid solubility, thereby diminishing the likelihood of uric acid precipitation in the tubules.</p><p>However, this approach has fallen out of favor for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no data demonstrating the efficacy of this approach. In addition, the only available experimental study suggested that hydration with saline alone is as effective as alkalinization in minimizing uric acid precipitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alkalinization of the urine has the potential disadvantage of promoting calcium phosphate deposition in the kidney, heart, and other organs in patients who develop marked hyperphosphatemia once tumor breakdown begins.</p><p/><p>Based upon these observations, the expert panel concluded that use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> was only indicated in patients with metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The panel could not reach a consensus regarding alkalinization in patients who will receive treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> but suggested that high serum phosphate levels preclude the use of sodium bicarbonate in such patients. If alkalinization is used, it should be initiated when the serum uric acid level is high and discontinued when hyperphosphatemia develops. Alkalinization of the urine is not required in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasburicase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasburicase</a>.
