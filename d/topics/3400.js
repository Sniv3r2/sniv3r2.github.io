Some studies have suggested that earlier tilting disc valve types (eg, Omniscience, Lillehei-Kaster, Bjork-Shiley Monostrut) were associated with increased risk of thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The earlier Bjork-Shiley convexo-concave single tilting disc valve was withdrawn from the market in 1986 due to reports of outlet strut fractures. The older caged ball valve (eg, Starr-Edwards) had unfavorable hemodynamic qualities and posed a high risk of thromboembolism and is no longer implanted. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bioprosthetic valve options include pericardial and xenograft (porcine, bovine, or equine) valves. Pericardial and xenograft valves may be stented or stentless. Bioprosthetic aortic valve options also include aortic homografts and the Ross procedure (pulmonary autograft in the aortic position). Stented bioprosthetic valves are the most common bioprosthetic option.

Comparisons of bioprosthetic valve series suggest that second generation porcine valves and pericardial valves are more durable than first generation porcine valves; newer models may yield even greater durability but data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

A study of 25,445 patients undergoing surgical prosthetic valve replacement in California from 1996 to 2013 found that 30-day mortality rates were similar for recipients of aortic bioprosthetic and mechanical valves (2.4 and 1.6 percent for patients aged 45 to 54 years; 1.6 and 1.7 percent for patients aged 55 to 64 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Mortality was not significantly different between valve types among patients 70 to 79 years of age. These relationships were not affected by adjustment for differences in baseline risk factors. In an analysis examining age as a continuous variable, the mortality benefit associated with a mechanical mitral valve applied to patients up to approximately 68 years of age.</p><p/><p>By contrast, an earlier meta-analysis of 32 observational studies with a total of 17,439 patients operated on between 1975 and 2002 found no difference in risk factor-adjusted overall mortality rate between bioprosthetic or mechanical AVR, regardless of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A limitation of this meta-analysis is that it included limited follow-up data for patients less than 60 years old receiving bioprosthetic valves. </p><p>The available randomized trial data are for valves that are now obsolete, patient numbers were limited, and results were not stratified by age. In a randomized trial including 575 patients (of which &gt;90 percent of patients were &le;70 years old) undergoing valve replacement between 1977 and 1982, survival at 15 years was higher with a mechanical aortic valve than with a bioprosthetic aortic valve (34 versus 21 percent); by contrast, survival was similar after mechanical or bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement (19 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. By contrast, another randomized trial including 541 patients (with mean age 54 at time of valve replacement) operated on between 1975 and 1979 found no difference in mortality rates at 20 years in patients receiving Bjork-Shiley or porcine prostheses (75 versus 77 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In older patients (eg, 65 years and older), long-term survival with a bioprosthetic valve has been reported as similar to or slightly better than that with a mechanical valve (in the aortic or mitral position). Although a large Medicare-claims-based study found a slight survival benefit in patients receiving bioprosthetic aortic valves compared with those receiving mechanical aortic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], a later report using Medicare claims linked to clinical data for risk adjustment and treatment assessment found similar long-term mortality rates in patients receiving bioprosthetic versus mechanical aortic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116781257\"><span class=\"h2\">Valve durability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical valves are more durable than bioprosthetic valves, as demonstrated by randomized trials and also seen in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/12,14,17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,17-21</a>]. Structural valve degeneration is a much more frequent cause of primary valve failure than valve obstruction (thrombotic or nonthrombotic). Bioprosthetic structural valve degeneration leads to significantly higher rates of reoperation in patients receiving these valves. While structural valve degeneration is the major reason for prosthetic valve reoperation, rates of valve reoperation do not fully capture the risk of structural valve degeneration since some patients with significant structural valve deterioration are not deemed candidates for reoperation due to high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of bioprosthetic structural valve deterioration is lower in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/14,17,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17,21-24</a>]. In addition, older patients generally have shorter anticipated survival during which they are at risk for requiring replacement of a deteriorated bioprosthetic valve. The lower rate of valve failure requiring valve reoperation in older adults is due at least in part to decreased activity in older patients. </p><p>The 15-year risk of bioprosthetic structural deterioration is 50 percent for patients 20 years old, 30 percent for patients 40 years old, and &lt;10 percent for patients 70 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/4,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,25,26</a>]. </p><p> While young patients are generally more likely to require valve reoperation than older patients, evidence is mixed as to how the risks associated with reoperation (as compared with risks of long-term anticoagulation with a mechanical valve) impact overall long-term survival, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H116780798\" class=\"local\">'Mortality rates'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3741424894\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidence of reoperation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a consequence of the age-dependent risk of bioprosthetic structural valve deterioration, the incidence of prosthetic valve reoperation is significantly higher for bioprosthetic valves compared with mechanical valves, and younger patients require reoperation sooner than older patients. As an example, in an observational study, the cumulative rates of reoperation at 15 years for patients aged 45 to 54 years with aortic bioprosthetic valves and mechanical valves were approximately 21 and 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The cumulative rates of reoperation for patients aged 55 to 64 years at 15 years with aortic bioprosthetic valves and mechanical valves were approximately 17 and 7 percent. Significantly higher rates of reoperation with bioprosthetic valves compared with mechanical valves were also seen with mitral prostheses, particularly among younger patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H581211904\"><span class=\"h3\">Risks associated with reoperation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical replacement of a prosthetic valve is associated with significant risk of early mortality (eg, 30-day mortality risk of 7 percent after aortic valve reoperation and 14 percent after mitral valve reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]). The individualized risk of a reoperation should be considered. The morbidity and mortality associated with valve reoperation is higher in some patient populations, such as those with coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). Retrospective data indicate that operative mortality rates are higher for aortic or mitral valve replacement with pre-existing CABG and are also higher than for combined valve replacement and CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. In a patient with a patent internal mammary artery (IMA) graft, valve surgery poses a potential risk of IMA graft injury and myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>The increased risk associated with valve reoperation in a patient following CABG may favor implantation of a mechanical valve in patients requiring concurrent valve replacement and CABG. However, the emerging use of treating bioprosthetic valve degeneration with a transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure may offer patients an alternative to repeat surgical valve replacement. Currently, there are limited data on the long-term durability of this approach, so strong recommendations are not possible.
