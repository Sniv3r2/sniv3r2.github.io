The causes include various self-limited illnesses and others that are potentially disabling and life-threatening. The history and physical examination generally provide the most useful diagnostic information; supporting or confirmatory data are obtained from laboratory and imaging studies or, more rarely, from tissue biopsy. A complete history and physical examination are appropriate for all patients presenting with polyarticular joint pain, since this symptom may be the initial manifestation of a systemic illness.</p><p>The list of causes of polyarticular pain is lengthy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] and includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyarthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74266\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74266 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral arthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73403 \">table 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postinfectious or reactive arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibromyalgia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple sites of bursitis or tendinitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothyroidism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathic pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic bone disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression</p><p/><p>The diagnostic possibilities can be narrowed substantially depending upon whether or not arthritis is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79481\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79481 \">algorithm 1</a>). Among those in whom there are symptoms and signs of synovitis, the further evaluation is limited to those diseases which cause polyarthritis. In the absence of clear-cut arthritis, the focus shifts to nonarticular sources of pain.</p><p>Despite the lengthy list of diseases that cause polyarthritis, many patients with inflammatory arthritis appear to have only one of a few possible disorders. Among over 200 patients with early synovitis (defined as less than one-year duration) evaluated at one academic center, 60 percent were diagnosed with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or a spondyloarthropathy at presentation or during the following year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The prognosis is relatively good for those who remain unclassifiable, with nearly one-half of such patients undergoing remission and not requiring any pharmacologic therapy at follow-up at one year.</p><p>This topic review will address polyarticular joint pain in adults. Evaluations of the adult with monoarticular pain and of children with joint pain are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of monoarthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-with-joint-pain-and-or-swelling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the information obtained in the history is seldom sufficient to lead to a specific diagnosis, it allows substantial reduction in reasonable options. An acute presentation with migratory arthritis and fever, for example, is characteristic of rheumatic fever, disseminated gonococcal infection, and viral arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal emergencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of polyarticular pain begins by ruling out potential musculoskeletal emergencies. These conditions generally have an acute presentation and are more commonly associated with monoarticular or oligoarticular pain. Some of these emergencies, however, can be seen in patients with polyarticular pain, and failure to make the correct diagnosis could lead to permanent harm to the patient. Important historical points include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hot or swollen joints may suggest infection (although bacterial infection more commonly presents with acute monoarthritis).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, malaise) are nonspecific but raise the suspicion of infection or sepsis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain greater than expected from physical findings may be a symptom of a compartment syndrome.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning pain, numbness, or paresthesia may suggest an acute myelopathy, radiculopathy, or neuropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to obtain a detailed history of the character of the joint pain, including pain quality, time of onset, exacerbating or remitting factors, and duration.</p><p>The quality of the pain may be useful in distinguishing musculoskeletal from neurologic causes. The latter is suggested when pain is &quot;burning&quot; or is accompanied by numbness or paresthesias. Neuropathic pain is also likely to be constant, to be intensified at night, and to be unrelated to motion. However, an individual patient may experience more than one type of pain. As an example, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) frequently have neuropathic pain due to carpal tunnel syndrome.</p><p>The two main categories of arthritis, inflammatory and noninflammatory, can often be distinguished based upon the character and distribution of joint pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With inflammatory arthritis, symptoms tend to worsen with immobility; this accounts for the typical morning stiffness and &quot;gelling&quot; that typically accompanies inflammatory arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, the pain of osteoarthritis (OA), the most common type of noninflammatory arthritis, is usually aggravated by motion and weightbearing and is relieved by rest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The joint involvement in RA is usually symmetrical, whereas asymmetry is frequent in OA, especially in the large joints. Problems such as bursitis, tendinitis, or sprains and strains are also asymmetrical in most cases.</p><p/><p>The duration of symptoms may also be helpful. Synovitis that has been present for less than six weeks could represent a viral arthritis or systemic rheumatic disease, whereas a longer duration would increase the likelihood of the latter. The ability to accurately classify patients with early inflammatory arthritis is difficult. In one study of 211 patients with recent-onset synovitis, 36 percent could not be classified and were designated as having &quot;undifferentiated arthropathy&quot; after follow-up of 33 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific viruses that cause arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undifferentiated early inflammatory arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of extraarticular symptoms may help to narrow the differential diagnosis. Weakness suggests a neurologic or myopathic disorder. On the other hand, signs and symptoms of multisystem involvement (such as fatigue, rash, adenopathy, alopecia, oral and nasal ulcers, pleuritic chest pain, Raynaud phenomenon, or dry eyes and mouth) are common in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases. Fever, night sweats, and weight loss may also suggest systemic illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other clues from the history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The remainder of the history should focus on the usual areas, including past medical history, family history, social history, and system review. Particular attention should be paid to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional capacity &ndash; This includes assessing the patient's ability to perform usual activities of daily living. Changes in functional status may lead to depression, anxiety, and loss of independence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of joint injury &ndash; A past medical history of previous trauma, fracture, or surgical procedures on symptomatic joints may help identify the cause of pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for or a history of infection &ndash; For example, exposure to or past infection with viral hepatitis may suggest the diagnosis of viral arthralgia. Exposure to ticks or young children may suggest Lyme disease or parvovirus infection, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete medication list &ndash; A review of medications may lead to a specific diagnosis, such as drug-induced lupus, or may alter treatment choices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychologic state and social support system &ndash; The more chronic conditions can greatly affect the life of the patient and his or her family.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL SIGNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a complete history, the physical examination is used to further narrow the differential diagnosis. As an example, acute lower-extremity pain may have many causes; however, septic arthritis, crystal-induced arthritis, or fracture should be suspected when the pain results in inability to bear weight, or is associated with soft tissue swelling and other signs of inflammation extending far above or below the involved joint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important objective of the physical examination is to establish the presence or absence of synovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Detecting synovitis increases the likelihood of an inflammatory arthritis or systemic rheumatic diseases. The hallmarks of synovitis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warmth over a joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of motion</p><p/><p>Reduced active range of motion with preserved passive range of motion suggests soft tissue disorders such as bursitis, tendinitis, or muscle injury. If both active and passive ranges of motion are decreased, soft tissue contracture, inflammatory or noninflammatory joint disease, or a structural abnormality of the joint should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Joint examination is also helpful to confirm the absence of synovitis or the presence of bony enlargement or crepitus, as is typical of osteoarthritis (OA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">General examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings on general examination may point to a systemic condition. These findings include lymphadenopathy, parotid enlargement, oral ulcerations, heart murmurs, pericardial or pleural friction rubs, or fine inspiratory rales due to interstitial lung disease.</p><p>Fever suggests a subset of infectious and rheumatic illnesses including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postinfectious or reactive arthritis (post-enteric infection, rheumatic fever)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic rheumatic disease, including Still's disease, vasculitis, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crystal-induced arthritis (gout and calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition [CPPD] disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other diseases such as cancer, sarcoidosis, and mucocutaneous disorders</p><p/><p>Additional findings may suggest a specific disease process. Examples of such findings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of subcutaneous nodules may be due to rheumatoid nodules or tophi.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin lesions may suggest that the joint symptoms are due to infective endocarditis, psoriatic arthritis, SLE, viral infection, or Still's disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye disease, including keratoconjunctivitis sicca, uveitis, conjunctivitis, and episcleritis, is also a feature of certain rheumatic illnesses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant axial pain or stiffness suggests the possibility of axial spondyloarthritis or another seronegative spondyloarthritis. As a result, spinal tenderness, deformity, and range of motion should always be ascertained in patients with polyarticular joint pain.</p><p/><p>In addition, soft tissue tender points characteristic of fibromyalgia are particularly important to identify in patients who have no objective abnormalities in the joints (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>). However, joint tenderness may occur in some fibromyalgia patients, and patients with various types of polyarthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SLE, and Lyme disease, may have superimposed fibromyalgia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory studies are not always necessary to make a diagnosis and, in fact, can be misleading. As an example, some patients with osteoarthritis (OA) may have abnormal results that actually reflect other unrelated conditions. In addition, in some patients with arthralgias and myalgias without physical findings, managing symptoms and carefully following the patient over several weeks may be more prudent than an initial battery of tests. Laboratory testing is also unnecessary when a mechanical or extraarticular problem has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>When the initial history and physical exam do not yield a diagnosis, however, some diagnostic testing may be indicated. Standard hematologic tests, urinalysis, and biochemical tests (renal and liver function) may help to identify patients with systemic illnesses. Other more specialized tests are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythrocyte sedimentation rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonspecific indicators of inflammation, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), are helpful in distinguishing between inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions. However, these tests are never diagnostic and may be abnormal in a vast array of infectious, malignant, rheumatic, and other diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The CRP is sometimes a more reliable indicator of the acute phase response than the ESR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], as the latter may be influenced by abnormal red blood cell morphology and a host of other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Furthermore, there are numerous examples of the ESR yielding results that are not consistent with the actual rheumatologic process:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease have a normal ESR. As an example, in one series of 9,135 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the ESR was normal in 71 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In noninflammatory arthritis, the ESR may be elevated because of another problem, such as renal failure, diabetes, hyperlipoproteinemia, dysproteinemia, or occult malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ESR may increase with age in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This phenomenon may be the basis for apparent ESR elevations in some OA patients.</p><p/><p>Despite these limitations, the ESR may provide confirmatory information when a certain diagnosis is favored based upon the history and physical findings. In an older patient with aching and stiffness in the hip and shoulder girdle areas, for example, the post-test probability of polymyalgia rheumatica increases if the ESR is markedly elevated. However, a normal ESR does not preclude the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibody tests can identify exposure to potential pathogens (group A streptococcus, viruses such as parvovirus or hepatitis B and C, <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific viruses that cause arthritis&quot;</a>). In addition, certain autoantibodies are associated with a limited group of illnesses and may add diagnostic specificity to a clinical suspicion of rheumatic disease (such as anti-native DNA or anti-Sm in systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibodies-to-double-stranded-ds-dna-sm-and-u1-rnp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibodies to double-stranded (ds)DNA, Sm, and U1 RNP&quot;</a>). These antibody tests should not be ordered routinely but should be reserved for cases in which there is a reasonable clinical suspicion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] (see below). The indiscriminate use of panels of these tests will result in a high frequency of false-positive results and in additional expensive and unnecessary testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Antinuclear antibody</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antinuclear antibody (ANA) test has high sensitivity but low specificity for SLE. Therefore, unless another cause is evident, it is generally appropriate to order an ANA in patients with polyarthritis since a negative test essentially rules out a diagnosis of SLE. A positive ANA may occur, however, in many rheumatic and nonrheumatic illnesses as well as in healthy individuals. Thus, a patient with few or no clinical features of SLE is unlikely to have the disease, even in the presence of a positive ANA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional information may help clarify the meaning of a positive ANA. The higher the ANA titer, the more likely that the patient has either SLE or another ANA-associated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additional serologic tests, such as anti-double-stranded (ds)DNA antibodies, may be diagnostic or at least may further limit the differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Rheumatoid factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rheumatoid factor should be ordered when RA is suspected due to signs or symptoms of inflammatory arthritis; however, the test has limited diagnostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Approximately one-third of patients with RA remain seronegative throughout their course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Furthermore, patients with other inflammatory or infectious diseases (such as SLE, infective endocarditis, vasculitis, viral infection) may have a positive test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74945 \">table 3</a>). High rheumatoid factor titers have a better predictive value for the diagnosis of RA and may also predict poor outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=origin-and-utility-of-measurement-of-rheumatoid-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Origin and utility of measurement of rheumatoid factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibodies to citrullinated peptides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-citrullinated <span class=\"nowrap\">peptide/protein</span> antibodies (ACPA) are frequently found in patients with RA. ACPA, detected by anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody testing, are more specific than rheumatoid factor for diagnosing RA and may predict erosive disease more effectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum uric acid concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum uric acid levels are usually elevated in gout, but, since asymptomatic hyperuricemia has a high prevalence in the general population, the finding of hyperuricemia has little diagnostic value. In addition, normal uric acid levels are fairly common during an attack of gout, including in patients with polyarticular involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], although the finding of a uric acid level below the lower limit of the normal reference range would make the diagnosis of gout much less likely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial fluid analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synovial fluid analysis may be diagnostic in patients with bacterial infections or crystal-induced synovitis. Synovial fluid analysis is also valuable to permit classification into an inflammatory or noninflammatory category, to identify hemarthrosis, and to identify crystals and infectious organisms. Patients with established rheumatic disease present a particular challenge as it may be difficult to distinguish a flare of the underlying disease from a new, concomitant disorder, including infectious arthritis. While the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) clinical guidelines suggest that synovial fluid analysis be performed in the febrile patient with an acute flare of established arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], such testing can be recommended for any patient, with or without prior rheumatic disease, when the diagnosis is uncertain after history, physical examination, and standard laboratory tests. This is especially important when crystal-induced arthritis or septic arthritis are suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The white cell count, differential count, cultures, Gram stain, and polarized light microscopy are the most valuable studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17</a>]. Noninflammatory fluids generally have fewer than 2000 white blood <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> with fewer than 75 percent polymorphonuclear leukocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76506 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The ACR guidelines suggest that unexplained inflammatory fluid, particularly in a febrile patient, should be assumed to be infected until proven otherwise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies are expensive and are not required routinely in the evaluation of polyarticular pain. Even when useful, it is seldom necessary to obtain radiographs of all involved joints; those joints with the highest yield in the differential diagnosis should be chosen. As an example, if rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the suspected diagnosis, erosions are best visualized in the wrist, hand, and foot.</p><p>In acute conditions, radiographs usually lack diagnostic specificity and are generally not helpful for patients with new onset of RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), gout, tendinitis, or bursitis. In several acute settings, however, plain films may be useful. Chondrocalcinosis, for example, may be seen in calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;</a>). On the other hand, abnormalities of the sacroiliac (SI) joints are the earliest radiographic finding in ankylosing spondylitis and serve to point toward seronegative spondyloarthropathy as the cause of peripheral polyarthritis.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines make the following general recommendations after completion of a thorough history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79481\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79481 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-adult-with-polyarticular-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the presence of synovitis and symptoms greater than six weeks in duration, consider rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other systemic rheumatic diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74266\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74266 \">table 1</a>). A complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), antinuclear antibody (ANA), plasma creatinine concentration, and urinalysis should be obtained. Joint aspiration should be considered if an effusion is present and if the diagnosis is uncertain, especially if septic or crystal-induced arthritis is suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the presence of synovitis and symptoms less than six weeks in duration, a complete blood count, measures of liver function tests, and, in some cases, serologic testing for hepatitis B and C and parvovirus may be helpful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73403 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of synovitis, the physical examination finding of tender points suggests fibromyalgia or multiple sites of bursitis or tendinitis; further diagnostic testing is not needed.
