Evidence suggests that the entire breast drains to the same few sentinel lymph nodes regardless of the injection site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These few lymph nodes are called &quot;sentinel&quot; lymph nodes, the status of which would accurately predict the status of the remaining lymph nodes. </p><p>Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was first introduced as a technique of axillary nodal staging for breast cancer by Giuliano and Krag in 1993 and 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. It has since become the standard of care for axillary staging in clinically node-negative breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A properly performed SLNB identifies patients who need further axillary clearance, while sparing others a potentially morbid axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The techniques of SLNB in breast cancer will be reviewed here. The indications, contraindications, and outcomes of SLNB as well as the management of patients after an SLNB are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper surgical technique in SLNB minimizes the risk of understaging and undertreating patients, which in turn influences outcomes. </p><p>SLNB typically begins with injection of one or two tracers into breast skin or parenchyma either in the vicinity of the tumor or under the areolar plexus. These tracers enter lymphatic channels and passively flow to the draining lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph nodes are then identified as those first receiving drainage from the tumor by the presence of tracer and removed. Although sentinel nodes draining the breast can be variably located, they are usually found within the lower axilla (level I) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Clinical practices vary regarding the tracer(s) and injection technique for SLNB. Each surgeon needs to find the method that works best for his or her practice. The sections below describe best practices for each tracer agent as suggested by the experts in the field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Blue dye</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The surgeon injects 3 to 5 mL of blue dye (1% isosulfan blue or diluted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>) around the tumor periphery, at the palpable edge of the biopsy cavity or into the subareolar plexus. It is important not to inject the dye into the tumor itself (because the lymphatics can be occluded by tumor) or into the seroma cavity following breast biopsy (as the seroma itself does not contain lymphatic channels). These errors in technique are likely to lead to a failure of mapping. </p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosulfan-blue-dye-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosulfan blue dye</a> for SLNB is associated with severe anaphylactic reactions requiring resuscitation in 0.7 to 1.1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/6,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-10</a>]. However, routine prophylaxis is not standard practice due to the low reported rate of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In high-risk cases, prophylactic treatment with 100 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> (or 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> or 4 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>), 50 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, and 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famotidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famotidine</a> intravenously just before or at the induction of anesthesia appears to decrease the severity but not the incidence of dye reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. &#160;</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylene blue</a> is an alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosulfan-blue-dye-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosulfan blue dye</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Methylene blue also has side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Intradermal injection of methylene blue can lead to skin necrosis; intraparenchymal injection can cause induration and erythema with associated pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Pulmonary edema and serotonin syndrome in patients who take serotonergic medications have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-syndrome-serotonin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin syndrome (serotonin toxicity)&quot;</a>). Side effects can potentially be minimized by diluting the methylene blue with normal saline (practices vary from 1:1 to 1:7 dilution) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Following tracer injection, the breast should be massaged for five minutes to dilate breast lymphatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The axillary fascia is then entered through an axillary incision. If blue dye is used as the sole tracer, the surgeon cannot rely on a gamma probe signal to identify the location of the sentinel node. In that situation, the incision should be placed inferiorly, rather than centered within the axilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Some surgeons make the incision at the inferior edge of the axillary hair, extending medially to the border of the pectoralis major muscle. Any incision for SLNB should be made in a way that can be incorporated into the incision for a subsequent completion ALND if necessary.</p><p>A careful and systematic search is then made for blue lymphatic channels. Once identified, these fragile blue lymphatic channels should be followed with gentle, ideally bloodless dissection, until they lead to blue-stained lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74726\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74726 \">figure 1</a>). All blue lymph nodes and any lymph nodes at the end of a blue lymphatic channel are removed and designated as sentinel nodes. Care must be taken to identify the bluest node and the blue node most proximal to the tumor in the axilla, because the dye transit time is rapid and blue staining of distal, nonsentinel axillary lymph nodes is not uncommon. Failure to consider the node at the end of a blue lymphatic channel as a sentinel node, whether or not the node itself appears blue, and failure to remove the most proximal blue node are two common technical errors. Suspicious palpable nodes should also be removed for evaluation, as a lymph node replaced with tumor is likely not to take up the tracer dye.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Radioactive colloid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The radioactive material may be injected peritumorally, intradermally, or into the subareolar plexus. There is ongoing debate about the best site for injection. Intradermal injection of radiocolloid appears to be superior to subdermal injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Injections into the dermis and subareolar area are associated with a lower potential for internal mammary node visualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, both filtered and unfiltered technetium sulfur colloid agents are normally used; others use technetium-labeled human serum albumin. When available, unfiltered radioactive colloid is better for SLNB because the larger particles in the unfiltered solution are trapped better by the sentinel lymph nodes. Filtered colloid is more suitable for lymphoscintigraphy by quickly identifying the sentinel nodes before passing onto second and third echelon nodes in the axilla.</p><p>The amount of radioactive colloid injected varies based on the time of injection; the half-life of technetium sulfur colloid is six hours. Typically, 0.5 mCi is injected on the day of surgery, or 2.5 mCi is injected the day before surgery. Following breast massage, a handheld gamma probe is used to identify the maximum radioactivity in the axilla. </p><p>When a hot spot cannot be located with a gamma probe before incision, 10 to 40 mL of saline or local anesthetic can be injected into the site of previous radioactive colloid injection followed by repeat breast massage to increase the interstitial pressure and force more tracer into lymphatic channels. In patients who have had prior breast or axillary surgery, the normal lymphatic channels may be blocked, causing alternate drainage pathways to be formed. In such patients, the risk of failing to localize sentinel lymph nodes with a gamma probe is higher than usual, and a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the use of dual tracers may help better localize the sentinel nodes. (See <a href=\"#H1357853075\" class=\"local\">'Single versus dual technique'</a> below.)</p><p>An axillary skin incision is made over the &quot;hot spot.&quot; Again, any incision for SLNB should be made in a way that can be incorporated into the incision for a subsequent completion ALND if necessary. The lymph node with the most radioactivity as determined by the gamma probe is first removed, and an ex vivo count is obtained. Removal of subsequent lymph nodes follows the &quot;10 percent rule&quot; (ie, all lymph nodes with counts &gt;10 percent of ex vivo count of the most radioactive node should be removed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. On average, two to three sentinel lymph nodes are removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Once four or five sentinel lymph nodes have been removed, the value of additional nodes is extremely low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. If the residual axillary bed count is still &gt;10 percent of the most radioactive node, but uniform, some surgeons do not remove any additional nodes that are not suspicious by palpation, although this issue is controversial (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Optimum number of sentinel lymph nodes'</a> below). Any suspicious palpable nodes should be removed, regardless of whether they are radioactive, since tumor-laden nodes may not take up much tracer. (See <a href=\"#H1826546328\" class=\"local\">'Decreasing the false negative rate of SLNB'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with tumors in the upper outer quadrant or axillary tail of the breast, the gamma probe may fail to isolate the sentinel lymph nodes due to overlapping signals from the injection site and the axilla (ie, &quot;shine-through&quot;). Attaching a collimator to the gamma probe, making it more directional, may circumvent the problem. Other solutions include injecting radioactive colloid subareolarly, as opposed to peritumorally, or injecting a smaller volume of radioactive colloid. If the problem is discovered after injection, the surgeon should proceed with tumor resection, which eliminates the interference from the injection site when reevaluating the axilla afterwards. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3702656849\"><span class=\"h2\">Investigational techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other techniques for localizing sentinel lymph nodes have been reported utilizing novel tracers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> (ICG), superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), and microbubble contrast agent. However, these newer techniques have wide variability in results between studies, small patient numbers, and short patient follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. At this time, these techniques should be considered investigational until there is conclusive evidence that they can reliably identify sentinel lymph nodes, and with a low false negative rate. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ICG </strong>&ndash; The tracer agent, ICG, is injected directly into the breast (most studies use subareolar or intradermal sites). The sentinel nodes are then localized using a fluorescent imaging system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 12 nonrandomized comparative studies, ICG was equal to or better than radioactive colloid in localizing sentinel lymph nodes and tumor-positive sentinel nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>SPIO</strong> &ndash; The magnetic tracer agent, SPIO, is injected into the breast at a subareolar or intradermal location. The sentinel nodes are then localized using a handheld magnetometer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. In a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials, the SPIO technique was not inferior to the standard technique in identification rate (97.1 versus 96.8 percent), total lymph nodes retrieved (1.9 versus 1.8 nodes per patient), and false negative rate (8.4 versus 10.9 percent). The mean discordance rate between the two techniques was 3.9 percent (range 1.7 to 6.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microbubble contrast</strong> &ndash; The microbubble contrast agent based on the use of dispersion with sulfur hexafluoride gas is injected intradermally around the areola. Breast lymphatics are then visualized by contrast-enhanced ultrasound and followed to identify and biopsy axillary sentinel lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In a meta-analysis of five studies, this technique identified sentinel lymph nodes in 9.3 to 55.2 percent of patients with a sensitivity of 61 to 89 percent and a false negative rate of 6.6 to 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Unlike in melanoma, where lymphoscintigraphy is standard as these patients often have variable drainage patterns, the use of lymphoscintigraphy is more controversial in breast cancer. </p><p>In general, lymphoscintigraphy is not needed before SLNB, as a sensitive handheld gamma probe is used to systematically survey all potential regional node sites to identify the hot spots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In the operating room, a small skin incision is made over the hot spot and the handheld gamma probe is used to guide the surgeon to the labeled lymph nodes. Because this technique is easy to learn, proficiency using radioactive tracer (along with blue dye) is attained sooner than with blue dye alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Routine preoperative lymphoscintigraphy before SLNB can add cost and create scheduling conflicts unnecessarily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Selective preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, however, is advocated before repeat SLNB in patients who have had a previous SLNB or axillary node dissection on the same side, where there is a high likelihood of an abnormal drainage pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Intraoperative evaluation of sentinel nodes allows immediate ALND, which obviates the need for a second operation in certain patients, such as those who are undergoing mastectomy (and therefore will not receive postoperative radiation) and those who have received neoadjuvant therapy. For patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery, some surgeons perform intraoperative evaluation in all patients, while others defer to permanent pathology and perform a completion ALND as a second operation if necessary. Given that the criteria for completion ALND are not completely resolved, each surgeon must decide what would lead <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> to do a completion ALND and perform intraoperative evaluation of the sentinel lymph nodes accordingly.

It should be omitted if the information gained will not impact surgical decision making (eg, surgeon does not plan to proceed with ALND regardless of result). Additionally, ALND may be avoided in select patients who meet the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 criteria, if they only have one or two positive sentinel nodes. Following Z0011, the use of intraoperative sentinel node evaluation has decreased significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. The management of patients with positive sentinel nodes is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer#H164839\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Management after sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>Although several intraoperative techniques can be used to identify a positive sentinel node (inspection of the cut faces of the node, cytology of node imprints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], cell smears, cytokeratin staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frozen sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]), none of these methods will identify all patients with positive nodes intraoperatively because of sampling limitations. Evaluation is more accurate on the basis of permanent (paraffin) sections.</p><p>Although the average false negative rate of intraoperative sentinel lymph node evaluation is 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/9,24,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,24,65</a>], the range is wide. Additional refinements of intraoperative evaluation may improve the identification rate of nodal metastases. For example, the combination of frozen section and rapid cytokeratin immunostaining decreased the false negative rate of intraoperative analysis in a small prospective trial of 100 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Caution should be used, however, as cytokeratin immunostaining can be falsely positive, leading to unnecessary completion axillary lymph node dissection.</p><p>Identifying tiny metastases intraoperatively may not be clinically helpful; caution should be exercised to ensure that pathologists are certain of their diagnosis of a true macrometastasis prior to completion of axillary dissection. Indeed, in a prospective study of intraoperative evaluation of sentinel nodes with frozen section and touch prep analysis, there were 2 percent false positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]; most studies, however, have found the false positive rate to be 0. Although many patients would want to avoid a second operation if possible, there is no evidence that immediate completion ALND is associated with more favorable outcomes than a delayed procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Molecular methods using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been used to identify tumor-specific RNA from occult malignant cells in axillary lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Concerns about the RT-PCR approach include the fact that measurement of the size of the metastatic tumor and morphologic correlation is not possible and destructive processing of the sample is required. There is also the significant limitation of false positive results, caused by benign epithelial inclusions, which could lead to erroneous upstaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p>Permanent sections remain the gold standard, and patients must be informed as to the possibility that a second operation may be necessary for completion of the ALND. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer#H164839\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Management after sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1826546328\"><span class=\"h1\">DECREASING THE FALSE NEGATIVE RATE OF SLNB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a set of patients undergoing SLNB, the false negative rate is calculated as the number of false negative cases divided by the number of cases with any axillary nodal metastasis (ie, true negative cases plus false negative cases). The false negative rate of SLNB is an important measure of procedural accuracy in the surgical management of breast cancer. Potential adverse outcomes from missing node metastases include understaging the patient and an increased risk of cancer recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Thus, every effort is made to reduce the false negative rate.</p><p>A systematic review of 69 trials of SLNB, including 8059 patients, showed that sentinel lymph nodes could be identified in 95 percent of patients with a false negative rate of 7.3 percent (range 0 to 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The false negative rate of SLNB is influenced by multiple surgeon and patient factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When performed by experienced surgeons, SLNB is a safe procedure with few complications. However, a significant amount of experience is necessary to master the procedure. Proper performance requires significant training, and results vary according to a surgeon's skill and experience.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The importance of experience to the accuracy of the SLNB technique was illustrated in a multicenter trial in which all patients underwent SLNB followed by completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Although the false negative rate varied between 0 and 29 percent among the participating surgeons, proficiency improved with increasing number of cases. After five training cases, the success rates for individual surgeons identifying a sentinel lymph node ranged from 79 to 98 percent. In another study, the false negative rate was more than halved when performed by surgeons who had performed &ge;20 cases of SLNB previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The success of the sentinel node biopsy is dependent on lymphatic drainage. A previous excisional biopsy has the potential to increase the false negative rate compared with prior percutaneous biopsy. Because of this, open surgical biopsies should be avoided if diagnosis with core biopsy is possible. If open surgical biopsy has already been performed, care should be taken to avoid injecting the blue dye or the radioactive tracer directly into the seroma cavity. Patients with prior breast or axillary surgery may benefit from preoperative lymphoscintigraphy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the dual tracer technique. (See <a href=\"#H1357853075\" class=\"local\">'Single versus dual technique'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoscintigraphy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The false negative rate is directly related to the number of sentinel nodes removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In the NSABP B-32 study, removal of two sentinel nodes rather than one almost halved the false negative rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. All nodes that qualify as sentinel nodes should be removed, not just the bluest or hottest nodes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Optimum number of sentinel lymph nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gentle palpation of the axilla through the incision should also be done to identify any firm suspicious nodes. In the B-32 trial, 4 percent of all sentinel nodes were identified by palpation, and almost one-quarter of these contained metastases. Other series also note that approximately one-half of patients in whom the identified sentinel node proves to be falsely negative will have clinically suspicious nodes palpable at surgery. This is thought to be because gross tumor involvement interferes with the uptake of both radiocolloid and blue dye, and lymph flow is diverted to a node other than the true sentinel node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/22,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,75</a>]. Therefore, not only should blue and hot lymph nodes be removed, but palpably suspicious lymph nodes should also be considered sentinel nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The false negative rates are similar for all standard techniques of SLNB and are dictated by anatomy. Cadaver studies suggest that lymphatic watersheds exist in the breast and that direct drainage may occur to multiple nodes in the axilla and other nodal regions, rather than an orderly and predictable pattern of lymphatic drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer-techniques/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Histologic examination of excised lymph nodes is the most accurate method for assessing spread of disease to these nodes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard of care for axillary staging in clinically node-negative breast cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A standard SLNB can be performed with blue dye <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radioactive colloid. Besides surgeon preference, the use of dual tracers may be warranted in situations including surgeon inexperience, a history of prior breast or axillary surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, obesity, or failure to localize with a single tracer agent. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1357853075\" class=\"local\">'Single versus dual technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine lymphoscintigraphy before SLNB is not required. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy should be performed before repeat SLNB in patients who have had a previous SLNB or axillary node dissection on the same side because of a high likelihood of an abnormal drainage pattern. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoscintigraphy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Successful sentinel lymph node identification by blue dye is defined as the identification of any blue node or any nonblue node with a blue afferent lymphatic. For SLNB with radioactivity, the &quot;10 percent rule&quot; has been proposed as a guideline, which refers to removal of all nodes with counts greater than 10 percent of the most radioactive node. On average, two or three sentinel nodes are identified. While some authors stop the procedure after removing three sentinel lymph nodes, others continue until all lymph nodes meeting the criteria have been removed. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Optimum number of sentinel lymph nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative evaluation of the sentinel lymph nodes will not identify all patients with positive nodes because of sampling limitations and may also yield a false positive result. Permanent section is the most accurate method of assessment. Additionally, patients who meet certain criteria may not require completion axillary lymph node dissection despite having only one or two positive sentinel nodes. Given that the criteria for completion ALND are not completely resolved, each surgeon must decide what would lead <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> to do a completion ALND and perform intraoperative evaluation of the sentinel lymph nodes accordingly. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer#H164839\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Management after sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The false negative rate is an important measure of procedural accuracy of SLNB and can be minimized by percutaneous (core biopsy, fine needle aspiration) rather than surgical biopsy of the primary breast lesion, use of dual tracer, removal of any firm suspicious nodes noted at the time of surgery, and removal of more than one sentinel node. Surgeon experience is also an important factor.
