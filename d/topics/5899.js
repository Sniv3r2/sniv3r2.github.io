Primary ST elevation is generally associated with transmural ischemia while ST depression (not related to reciprocal changes) is associated with ischemia limited to the subendocardium. As will be described below, marked ST elevation or depression in multiple leads usually indicates very severe and widespread ischemia and therefore a worse outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Necrosis of sufficient myocardial tissue can lead to decreased R wave amplitude or frank Q waves due to loss of electromotive forces in the infarcted area. Thus, the reason why Q waves do or do not develop following coronary occlusion is related to the duration of occlusion, the area of myocardium at risk, and the extent to which myocardial viability is maintained during occlusion by remaining anterograde blood flow and the function of collaterals. The infarct-related artery is occluded in over 90 percent of cases. In contrast, coronary arteriography performed in the acute period of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) has shown that the infarct-related artery is not occluded in 60 to 85 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

Among patients with an MI, NSTEMI is associated with a lower in-hospital mortality but a similar or worse long-term outcome than ST elevation infarcts. The worse short-term outcome with ST elevation MI (STEMI) reflects a larger infarction that is presumably due to the much higher rate of complete occlusion of the infarct-related artery with STEMI than with NSTEMI. The similar or worse late prognosis with NSTEMI is in part related to a more than 50 percent prevalence of multivessel disease in patients with an NSTEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and a higher rate of recurrent ischemia and infarction than with STEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, a significant amount of myocardium remains at risk.

This issue was addressed more directly in an analysis from the GISSI-1 trial, which confirmed the value of ST segment elevations observed on the admission ECG in predicting in-hospital mortality, as well as mortality at both 30 days and long term in patients with a first MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Four distinct severity groups were defined based upon the number of ECG leads with ST elevation: two to three leads, four to five leads, six to seven leads, and more than eight leads. In-hospital, 30-day, and 10-year mortality increased progressively as the number of ECG leads with ST elevation increased, although not all differences were statistically significant. Furthermore, patients with more extensive disease showed greater benefit from thrombolytic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior wall infarction is associated with a worse prognosis than inferior wall infarction, mostly because of larger infarct size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. In one report that included both ST elevation and non-ST elevation infarctions, anterior infarcts had the following significant differences from inferior infarcts: a lower admission left ventricular ejection fraction (38 versus 55 percent), higher incidences of heart failure (41 versus 15 percent), serious ventricular arrhythmias, in-hospital mortality (11.9 versus 2.8 percent), and, at a mean duration of 30 months, total cardiac mortality (27 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a report from the SPRINT registry of patients with a first NSTEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients with an anterior infarction had a higher rate of in-hospital complications (heart failure and cardiogenic shock) and a higher in-hospital mortality (15 versus 10 percent) when compared to those with less extensive <span class=\"nowrap\">inferior/lateral</span> wall infarctions. They also had a higher one-year rate of recurrent infarction or cardiac death (14.2 versus 4.8 percent) and a higher five-year mortality (36 versus 22 percent). After adjustment for other risk factors, most of these differences did not reach statistical significance except for a higher one-year cardiac event rate (odds ratio 3.15, 95% confidence interval 1.59-6.78).</p><p>As a result of these and other findings, anterior wall infarction has been included as a risk factor in the TIMI risk scores for both STEMI (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-thrombolysis-in-myocardial-infarction-timi-score-for-st-elevation-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-thrombolysis-in-myocardial-infarction-timi-score-for-unstable-angina-or-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].

The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precordial ST segment depressions were associated with larger infarctions, more post-infarction complications (heart failure, second or third degree heart block, or shock) and a small but significant increase in mortality rate at 30 days and one year when compared to the absence of these changes. After adjustment for clinical risk factors, the magnitude of the ST depression (sum of leads V1-V6) added significant independent prognostic information, as the 30-day mortality increased by 36 percent for every 0.5 mV (5 mm) increment in summed precordial ST segment depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with concomitant ST segment depression in leads V4-V6 were more likely to have three-vessel disease than those with ST depression in leads V1-V3 or those without precordial ST segment depression (36 versus 16 and 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Such patients derive greater absolute benefit from reperfusion therapy with thrombolytic agents or percutaneous coronary intervention because they have a larger amount of myocardium at risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">QRS morphology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distinct QRS morphologies may also provide information relating to infarct size and prognosis. Data from the TIMI-4 trial suggested that the following distortion of the terminal portion of the QRS complex in two or more adjacent leads may be particularly informative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electrocardiogram-in-the-prognosis-of-myocardial-infarction-or-unstable-angina/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tall symmetric upright T waves and ST segment elevation accompanied, in leads with an initial QR configuration, by the J point at &ge;50 percent of the R wave amplitude (measured from the isoelectric line).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disappearance of the S wave in leads with an Rs configuration on admission ECG.</p><p/><p>Patients with either of these findings had larger infarct sizes and larger defects on nuclear imaging sestamibi scans than those without these findings.
