HCT patients are at risk for infectious diseases resulting from bacteria, fungi, viruses, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parasites, all of which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality than in immunocompetent individuals.</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; will be used throughout this topic as a general term to cover transplantation of hematopoietic cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). Possible sources for these cells include the patient's own cells (autologous); an identical twin (syngeneic, human leukocyte antigen [HLA] identical); a sibling, a related, or an unrelated donor (allogeneic; HLA identical, haploidentical, or mismatched); or umbilical cord blood (UCB; HLA identical, haploidentical, or mismatched).

This risk decreases with hematologic reconstitution, specifically with reconstitution of innate and adaptive cellular immune effectors. Immune reconstitution is typically faster in autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients than in allogeneic HCT recipients. In the allogeneic HCT recipients, immune reconstitution can be delayed by various factors, which are discussed below. Immune reconstitution following HCT is discussed in detail separately.

Similarly, many risk factors increase the risk for GVHD, including stem cell source (peripheral stem cell more than bone marrow) and HLA relatedness (mismatched or unrelated donor more than matched related).</p><p>A careful pretransplant screening of donor and recipient to evaluate the risk of posttransplant infection is one of the most important steps in the management of HCT recipients.

The three periods are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preengraftment &ndash; From transplantation to neutrophil recovery, approximately day 20 to 30</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early postengraftment &ndash; From engraftment to day 100</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late postengraftment &ndash; After day 100</p><p/><p>It is useful to think of the most likely infectious disease manifestations during each period among allogeneic and autologous HCT recipients and also to think of the clinical syndromes that occur during each period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50318\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50318 \">table 3</a>). Both perspectives offer complementary information. Knowledge of likely pathogens during each period facilitates decisions about the need for and potential benefit of prophylaxis and to allow the clinician to construct a differential diagnosis for clinical syndromes that occur. For many clinical syndromes that occur after HCT, there are possible infectious and noninfectious etiologies.</p><p>This division into time periods is artificial, but it is helpful in the management of HCT recipients. The timing and length of interval of each of these phases may vary according to the source of stem cells, degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and minor histocompatability antigen match, the type and intensity of conditioning regimen used, and any manipulation of the graft to remove T cells or other cell populations, the type of post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy (especially glucocorticoids), and the presence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In general, allogeneic HCT recipients are at risk for infection during all three periods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52716 \">figure 2</a>), whereas autologous HCT recipients are typically only vulnerable to infection during the pre- and immediate postengraftment periods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64491 \">figure 3</a>). During each of these time periods, patients can develop bacterial, fungal, viral, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parasitic infections, although certain pathogens tend to cause disease during some of these periods more frequently than others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50318\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50318 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>In HCT recipients, the general risk of infectious complications is not limited to the period of granulocytopenia but persists for 6 to 12 months after autologous HCT and 12 to 24 months after allogeneic HCT, until B and T cell immune recovery occurs. The period of increased risk for infection includes the period during which the patient is profoundly neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphopenic (absolute lymphocyte count &le;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infections-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Receipt of T cell suppressive therapies (high-dose glucocorticoids, anti&ndash;T cell antibodies, purine analogs, others), the occurrence of GVHD, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> receipt of a T cell&ndash;depleted hematopoietic cell graft may delay T cell recovery, and use of agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> may delay B cell recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-infections-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The risk for infection usually decreases six months after the last dose of T cell suppressive therapies or when the absolute lymphocyte count is &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (or the absolute CD4 count is &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> whichever is longer.
