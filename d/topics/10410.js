Among clinical factors affecting prognosis, older age and poor performance status have consistently been shown to be associated with shorter survival. The poorer prognosis of older adults and the relative lack of clinical trial data in this age group have led to uncertainty about optimal management. Treatment decisions in older adults can be additionally complicated by factors such as comorbid disease, polypharmacy, increased susceptibility to side effects, and social and economic vulnerability.</p><p>The available evidence and approach to older adults with glioblastoma will be reviewed here. The general approach to surgery, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with malignant gliomas is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, initial surgical approach, and prognosis of high-grade gliomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-postoperative-therapy-for-glioblastoma-and-anaplastic-astrocytoma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial postoperative therapy for glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma&quot;, section on 'Temozolomide'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy for high-grade gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175101\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSTIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older adults with glioblastoma have a worse prognosis compared with younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In population-based studies, the median survival of patients 65 years of age and older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is approximately six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Older adults also tend to receive less aggressive therapy, which may influence outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].</p><p>The most important prognostic factors affecting survival in patients with malignant glioma are age and performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 1</a>). In a large retrospective study that included over 700 patients with glioblastoma diagnosed at 70 years of age or older, the median age at diagnosis was 75 years and the median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Recursive partitioning analysis revealed four prognostic groups, with median overall survival stratified according to age and performance status as well as extent of resection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subgroup I (gross total resection or partial resection, age &lt;75.5 years) &ndash; 8.5 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subgroup II (gross total resection or partial resection, age &ge;75.5 years) &ndash; 7.7 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subgroup III (biopsy, KPS &ge;70) &ndash; 4.3 months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subgroup IV (biopsy, KPS &lt;70) &ndash; 3.1 months</p><p/><p>Molecular alterations also carry prognostic value in older adults, although certain markers, such as mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and codeletion of 1p and 19q, become increasingly rare with advancing age. The most valuable molecular prognostic factor in older adults is methylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (<em>MGMT</em>), which is present in approximately half of glioblastomas in patients over the age of 70 years and is associated with improved survival compared with unmethylated <em>MGMT</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas#H2597251\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, initial surgical approach, and prognosis of high-grade gliomas&quot;, section on 'MGMT methylation status'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175223\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies in younger adults support the value of maximal safe resection in patients with malignant glioma for the purposes of preserving neurologic function and improving survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, initial surgical approach, and prognosis of high-grade gliomas&quot;, section on 'Extent of resection'</a>.)</p><p>In older adults, maximal safe resection is likely beneficial as well, but factors such as medical comorbidities, effects of general anesthesia, and vulnerability to postoperative complications such as delirium weigh more heavily in the decision to operate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-older-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the older adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based on the available data, we suggest maximal surgical resection consistent with preservation of neurologic function rather than biopsy in older patients with glioblastoma. Subtotal resection or stereotactic biopsy alone may be preferred, however, depending upon the location and size of the tumor, general health of the patient, and overall goals of care.</p><p>Observational studies in older adults, including a meta-analysis and large population-based analysis using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, suggest that gross total resection and subtotal resection are associated with improved survival compared with biopsy alone or no surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/7,11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11-16</a>]. In the SEER database study, gross total resection conferred a two- to three-month survival advantage over subtotal resection, even after adjusting for tumor size, location, and receipt of radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This effect was present in all age groups examined, although the magnitude of the benefit decreased with advancing age.</p><p>A major limitation to the interpretation of observational studies, including meta-analyses of observational studies, is that they cannot completely control for factors that influence the decision to pursue surgery in the first place, and many of these factors are strongly associated with survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A randomized trial comparing surgical resection with biopsy in older patients with glioblastoma is ongoing in France and may help to address this question more fully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175314\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H961873324\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For older adults with glioblastoma, we suggest a treatment approach that depends primarily on the overall functional status of the patient postoperatively and molecular information about O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (<em>MGMT</em>) methylation status, if available in a timely manner after surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F93333\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93333 \">algorithm 1</a>). The three major treatment options (concurrent chemoradiation, radiation alone, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> alone) are discussed individually below.</p><p>Combined-modality therapy is the standard of care for younger patients with glioblastoma, but with advancing age the benefits become more closely balanced with risks of toxicity and side effects. Single-modality therapy is often better tolerated and is a common approach in older patients with a low functional status. In such patients, subgroup analyses from randomized trials support the role of <em>MGMT</em> status in helping to select between radiation and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. <em>MGMT</em> status is less helpful in patients with a good functional status who are candidates for concurrent chemoradiation, as both methylated and unmethylated patients appear to benefit from the addition of temozolomide to radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H749211\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>Careful assessment of the patient's overall clinical status and comorbidities is essential.

The risks of toxicity with the addition of chemotherapy are more closely balanced with the potential for improved survival in older patients compared with younger patients, however.

Eligible patients were 65 years of age or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 to 2. The trial included 562 patients with a median age of 73 years (range 65 to 90). Results include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> to radiation resulted in improved survival compared with radiation alone (9.3 versus 7.6 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.56-0.80). Progression-free survival was also improved (5.3 versus 3.9 months).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>MGMT</em> was analyzed in 354 patients.
