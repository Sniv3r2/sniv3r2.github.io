A general overview of metacarpal fractures and the management of other types of metacarpal fractures are discussed separately.

Metacarpal neck fractures are the most common and are usually due to direct trauma, typically involving young males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In younger and older populations, falls are another common mechanism of injury. Metacarpal neck fractures most often involve the fifth and to a lesser degree, the fourth metacarpal neck. Fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck (&quot;boxer's fractures&quot;) account for approximately 10 percent of all hand fractures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Finger and metacarpal anatomy are reviewed in greater detail separately; items of particular relevance to metacarpal neck fractures are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-metacarpal-fractures#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of metacarpal fractures&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>Metacarpals are often described using the numbers one through five. The first metacarpal refers to that associated with the thumb, the second to that associated with the index finger, and so on through the fifth metacarpal.</p><p>The heads of the metacarpals are bulbous and &quot;cam&quot; shaped, thereby permitting adduction, abduction, flexion, extension and passive rotation of the fingers. The collateral ligaments join the metacarpal to the proximal phalanx and are taut in flexion, while having some laxity in extension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65855 \">figure 1</a>). These characteristics have important implications for therapy. During splinting or casting, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints are typically immobilized in flexion to prevent shortening of the collateral ligaments and subsequent loss of motion.</p><p>The dorsal and volar interosseous muscles originate from the metacarpal shafts and insert onto the proximal phalanges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F95624\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95624 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F95625\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95625 \">figure 3</a>). These muscles serve as primary flexors of the MCP joint. In metacarpal neck (and shaft) fractures, the force exerted by these interosseous muscles predictably causes apex dorsal angulation of the fracture.</p><p>The common palmar digital arteries and nerves run parallel with the distal portion of each metacarpal. These structures can be injured in significantly displaced metacarpal neck fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual mechanism of injury with metacarpal neck fractures involves direct trauma to a clenched fist, such as punching a wall or solid object [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The &quot;roundhouse&quot; punching motion common in street fights (but rare in professional or high level amateur boxing) generally transmits significant force to the fifth metacarpal, resulting in fracture. Experienced boxers rarely sustain this type of fracture, and the term &quot;boxer's fracture&quot; is therefore a misnomer. Among children and older adults, falls onto the hand may cause a metacarpal fracture. However, unlike some other hand and wrist fractures, falls (particularly falls onto an outstretched hand [ie, FOOSH mechanism]) are NOT common mechanisms for metacarpal neck fractures. In addition to punching, direct blunt force trauma to the dorsum of the hand can cause these fractures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036385601\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation and general findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a metacarpal neck fracture typically present after sustaining direct trauma to the hand with complaints of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deformity along the dorsum of the hand overlying the involved metacarpal. The dorsum of the hand is swollen and focal bony tenderness is present over the fractured metacarpal. Significant tenderness or ecchymosis on the palmar (volar) surface is highly suggestive of fracture. The hand should be examined closely for signs of fracture angulation and malalignment, impaired extensor function of the fingers, and loss of skin integrity. Neurovascular status of the affected hand should be assessed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture angulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metacarpal neck fractures almost universally result in dorsal angulation of the apex of the fracture due to the pull of the interosseous muscles. As a result, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint is often depressed, causing loss of the usual knuckle contour. Angulation is determined using a lateral radiograph. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Rotational alignment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of rotational alignment is critical to the proper evaluation of all metacarpal fractures. Rotational alignment should be assessed with the MCP joint in flexion. The rotational alignment of the metacarpals can be assessed in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a semi-clenched fist (flexion to 90 degrees at the MCP and proximal interphalangeal [PIP] joints), normal alignment will show convergence of the digits but not necessarily to a single point (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73269%7EEM%2F71612\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73269 graphicRef71612 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the MCP joint flexed 90 degrees and the PIP and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints in full extension, the planes of the fingernails should be aligned in the uninjured hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52326\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52326 \">picture 2</a>). Alignment can be compared to the contralateral (ie, uninjured) hand. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Extensor apparatus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The function of the extensor apparatus should be evaluated in patients with metacarpal neck fractures. In a severely angulated fracture, efforts to extend the finger may result in hyperextension at the MCP joint with flexion at the PIP joint (so-called &quot;pseudo-clawing&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81613\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81613 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin integrity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Special attention must be paid to skin integrity near the metacarpal head since this site is particularly prone to injury caused by a tooth during an altercation (sometimes called a &quot;fight bite&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67311 \">figure 5</a>)). Any evidence of laceration or skin breakdown requires aggressive decontamination to avoid potentially disastrous intraarticular infections. Prophylactic antibiotics appear to be beneficial with hand bites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to human bites&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs are performed to establish the diagnosis of metacarpal neck fracture and to determine the degree of fracture angulation. In addition, clinicians facile with ultrasound often perform a bedside ultrasound examination to make the initial diagnosis. Observational studies suggest that ultrasound provides a quick and accurate means for diagnosing metacarpal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>With plain radiographs, three views of the hand (anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and oblique) adequately display metacarpal neck fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F60355%7ESM%2F53210\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60355 graphicRef53210 \">image 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66007\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66007 \">image 2</a>). Measurements of angulation should be performed on the <strong>lateral</strong> view using the shaft of the metacarpal and a line through the mid-point of the fracture fragment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Use of an oblique view results in an exaggerated measurement of angulation. Angulation is almost universally apex dorsal in metacarpal neck fractures.</p><p>Clinicians must remember that the normal head-to-neck angle of the metacarpals is 15 degrees, and angulation references are based upon this baseline. Thus, fracture angulation is equal to the measured angle on the lateral radiograph minus 15 degrees.</p><p>No clear consensus is established in the medical literature regarding acceptable degrees of fracture angulation. However, it is clear that the second and third metacarpals tolerate significantly less angulation than the fourth and fifth metacarpals due to their fixed proximal position at the carpometacarpal (CMC) joints.</p><p>Historically, a simple &quot;10, 20, 30, 40 rule&quot; was used to determine acceptable angulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The second metacarpal neck tolerates 10 degrees of angulation, the third 20 degrees, the fourth 30 degrees, and the fifth metacarpal up to 40 degrees of angulation without adversely affecting functional outcome (one small randomized trial and some observational evidence suggest acceptable results for uncomplicated fifth metacarpal neck fractures are achievable with up to 70 degrees of angulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The degree of fracture angulation that warrants surgical referral is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3256532267\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitive diagnosis of a metacarpal neck fracture is made by diagnostic imaging, usually a plain radiograph, but some clinicians use ultrasound to make the initial diagnosis. A history of direct trauma to the hand, most often a punch thrown against a stationary object by a young male, and findings of swelling along the dorsum of the hand, accompanied by focal bony tenderness at the distal metacarpal, suggest the presence of a fracture. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2226481942\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The injuries most commonly mistaken for a metacarpal neck fracture include hand contusion and metacarpal-phalangeal dislocation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2667277707\"><span class=\"h2\">Hand contusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A contusion of the hand sustained from direct trauma can present in similar fashion to a fracture, with significant pain, swelling of the dorsum of the hand, and bony tenderness. However, contusions are more often the result of a direct blow rather than force sustained by a clenched fist striking an object. In addition, fractures may have appreciable step-off on palpation whereas contusions will not. Often, imaging is warranted to distinguish between contusion and metacarpal fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130178380\"><span class=\"h2\">Metacarpal phalangeal dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dislocation at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint presents with obvious deformity, pain, and impaired flexion and extension at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. This can generally be distinguished from a metacarpal fracture based on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanism &ndash; MCP dislocation is typically be caused by pulling or twisting that exerts a sudden lateral, anterior, or posterior force to the phalanx. In contrast, a metacarpal neck fracture is typically caused by direct force from a clenched fist striking an object or a direct blow to the metacarpal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination &ndash; Loss of congruity at the articulation of distal metacarpal and proximal phalanx is palpable following dislocation. Diagnostic imaging (eg, plain radiograph) readily distinguishes dislocation from fracture and is warranted at presentation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after reduction of the dislocation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SURGICAL REFERRAL</span></p><p>The major indications for referral to a hand surgeon can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immediate</strong> surgical consultation is needed for open metacarpal neck fractures (laceration extends to bone) and injuries associated with major neurovascular impairment. Such injuries are uncommon. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex metacarpal neck fractures that are unstable and not amenable to conservative management, such as severely comminuted fractures and fractures with any rotational component, should be referred to a hand surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Rotational alignment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metacarpal neck fractures with significant angulation as described immediately below should be referred to a hand surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Limited angulation alone is functionally well tolerated in many metacarpal neck fractures. The traditional &quot;10, 20, 30, 40 rule&quot; can be used to determine the tolerability of fracture angulation, with the important exception of the fifth metacarpal. Cadaveric studies looking at the effect of different degrees of fracture angulation upon biomechanics suggest that any fracture angle greater than 30 degrees impairs motor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Therefore, offering referral to a hand surgeon for fourth and fifth metacarpal neck fractures with angulation &gt;30 degrees is reasonable. Our practice is to refer fourth metacarpal fractures with &gt;30 degrees angulation and discuss referral for all fifth metacarpal fractures &gt;30 degrees (we tend to refer fifth metacarpal fractures with angulation &gt;40 degrees).</p><p>Remember that the normal metacarpal head-to-neck angle is 15 degrees. Thus, fracture angulation is equal to the measured angle on the lateral radiograph minus 15 degrees.</p><p>Fractures angulated beyond acceptable levels are managed with closed reduction and immobilization or operative fixation to restore more normal alignment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74472\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74472 \">image 3</a>). Hand surgery referral should be obtained for such injuries if the primary care clinician is inexperienced in metacarpal fracture management. Referral is also necessary when adequate fracture reduction cannot be maintained.</p><p>Hand surgery consultation should be obtained for individuals whose occupations or hobbies require a great deal of fine motor movement or gripping of the hand (eg, musicians, craftsmen, seamstresses, baseball players). In addition, some patients may prefer less angulation for cosmetic reasons. Injury of the dominant hand and patient request are acceptable reasons for referral.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following discussion describes the initial therapeutic approach in patients who do not require immediate fracture reduction or surgical referral as described in the previous section. Initial therapy typically consists of a splint, since swelling often prevents optimal casting. Splinting is used in the initial immobilization of, and sometimes is the definitive treatment for, metacarpal fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>]. A detailed description of the techniques for applying splints is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An ulnar gutter splint is used to immobilize fractures of the fourth and fifth metacarpal necks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65376\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65376 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59409\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59409 \">figure 6</a>). The appropriate position for initial immobilization is 70 to 90 degrees of flexion at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, slight flexion at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, and mild wrist extension. A similar splint applied to the radial side of the hand with an opening to accommodate the thumb is used for fractures of the second and third metacarpal necks. </p><p>The application of ice to the injured area, elevation of the affected hand above the level of the heart, and appropriate analgesia are indicated during the first 48 to 72 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-acute-fracture-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of acute fracture management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Closed reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute reduction is indicated if there is pseudo-clawing as evidenced by hyperextension at the MCP joint and flexion at the PIP joint with attempted extension of the finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81613\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81613 \">figure 4</a>). Reduction is also needed for significantly angulated fourth or fifth metacarpal fractures. Acceptable degrees of angulation amenable to splinting without reduction are described in greater detail above. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above.) </p><p>There are several methods for reducing a metacarpal neck fracture; the following is our preferred approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, effective anesthesia is quickly obtained with a hematoma block. The placement of a hematoma block for metacarpal fractures is described separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metacarpal-shaft-fractures#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metacarpal shaft fractures&quot;, section on 'Anesthesia'</a>). Another effective option for anesthesia is an ulnar nerve block at the wrist, which is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques#H790721729\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Upper extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Ulnar nerve block'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once adequate anesthesia is confirmed, use the 90-90 method to reduce the fracture. Begin by flexing the MCP, PIP, and DIP joints all to 90 degrees. Next, direct pressure axially through the flexed PIP joint, thereby creating a dorsal force on the distal fracture fragment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60633\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60633 \">figure 7</a>). Simultaneously, apply a volar force over the fracture site until you sense that an anatomic reduction has been achieved. Then immobilize the fracture with a Burkhalter-type splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77846\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77846 \">picture 4</a>) or an ulnar gutter splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65376\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65376 \">picture 3</a>). Post-reduction radiographs are imperative to ensure adequate reduction and alignment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H710920757\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not uncommon for patients with metacarpal neck fractures, particularly ones involving the fifth metacarpal, to present for evaluation two weeks or longer after their injury. This may be due to denial or possibly embarrassment about the circumstances of the injury. In cases of delayed presentation, important factors to consider when deciding on appropriate management include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand function </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level of pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extent of bony healing (as determined with diagnostic imaging)</p><p/><p>Often, after three weeks or longer pain is minimal and function is intact, even with significantly angulated fractures. These patients are often comfortable with continuing conservative care. However, if function is impaired in any way, pain remains problematic, or angulation is unacceptable, referral to a hand surgeon is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">General follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with significantly angulated second (&gt;10 degrees) or third (&gt;20 degrees) metacarpal neck fractures should be seen again within three to five days, while fourth and fifth metacarpal fractures should be seen within one week. Repeat plain radiographs are indicated to look for evidence of worsened angulation, loss of reduction, or malrotation. The patient should be referred to a hand surgeon if any of these complications develop. Follow-up studies should be obtained at two-week intervals from that point forward until radiographic healing (callus and consolidation on plain radiograph) and clinical healing (nontender over fracture site) are present. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above.)</p><p>The definitive treatment for metacarpal neck fractures differs from other fractures in that a splint (noncircumferential immobilization) can be used for the entire duration of immobilization. For other metacarpal fractures (eg, head, shaft, or base), a splint is used for the first few days to permit swelling to diminish. A short arm cast (SAC) is then applied and used for the remaining period of immobilization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-metacarpal-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of metacarpal fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In minimally displaced fourth and fifth metacarpal neck fractures and nondisplaced second and third metacarpal neck fractures, simple immobilization for three to four weeks in a gutter or Burkhalter-type splint provides definitive treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77846\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77846 \">picture 4</a>). The splint should be worn continuously, and it is important to maintain at least 70 degrees of flexion at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints to avoid stiffening of the MCP collateral ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>The usual healing time for metacarpal neck fractures is four to six weeks, which does not appear to be shortened with surgical intervention. There should be evidence of radiographic healing (ie, callus formation around the fracture site) by four weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73161\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73161 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p>Following immobilization, there is often stiffness at the MCP and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. This is typically alleviated within a few weeks by performing passive and active range of motion exercises with these joints. These can be performed at home. If the patient is unable to regain adequate range of motion after two to three weeks using a home program, formal referral to occupational therapy may be necessary.</p><p>When fractures heal completely, approximately 50 percent of the initial deformity correction is typically maintained. Despite adequate reduction, residual cosmetic deformity may persist (loss of dorsal knuckle contour), but function is generally not impaired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Fifth metacarpal neck fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, many fifth metacarpal neck fractures are managed with an off-the-shelf Galveston splint or a custom orthosis; the latter is typically molded from low-temperature thermoplastic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These devices allow the use of other fingers and movement at the fifth PIP and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, while maintaining fracture position. This is particularly helpful in students (due to frequent writing) and older adults. Functional bracing of metacarpal neck fractures is often helpful for patients at high risk of developing joint stiffness (eg, older adults).</p><p>Many occupational therapists receive specific training in constructing and fitting custom orthoses to allow greater hand and finger mobility (and often greater comfort) than a plaster splint or cast, while maintaining fracture position.</p><p>No approach to the nonoperative management of fifth metacarpal neck fractures has been shown to be superior to rigid splint immobilization, but a few randomized trials report that soft wrap and buddy tape yield comparable outcomes to other, more rigid forms of immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

A more serious but rare complication of metacarpal neck fractures caused by crush injury is compartment syndrome, which is a surgical emergency. In patients with substantial associated soft tissue damage and persistent pain out of proportion to the injury despite appropriate splinting, compartment syndrome may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

They usually result from a direct blow to the hand or from striking an object with a clenched fist. Fifth metacarpal (metacarpal of little finger) neck fractures, sometimes called &quot;boxer's fractures,&quot; are most common. (See <a href=\"#H981575958\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a metacarpal neck fracture typically present after sustaining hand trauma with complaints of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deformity along the dorsum of the hand overlying the involved metacarpal. The dorsum of the hand is swollen and focal bony tenderness is present over the fractured metacarpal. Significant tenderness or ecchymosis on the palmar surface is highly suggestive of fracture. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hand should be examined closely for signs of fracture angulation, rotation, and malalignment, as well as impaired extensor function of the fingers, and loss of skin integrity. Metacarpal neck fractures almost universally result in dorsal angulation of the apex of the fracture, which often causes loss of the usual knuckle contour. Assessment of fracture angulation (using plain radiographs) and malrotation (using physical examination) are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and examination findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive diagnosis of metacarpal neck fractures is performed with plain radiographs, although skilled operators may use ultrasound for the initial diagnosis. Fractures are readily distinguished from the two common alternative diagnoses &ndash; hand contusion and metacarpal-phalangeal dislocation &ndash; by means of diagnostic imaging. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3256532267\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2226481942\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major indications for referral to a hand surgeon can be summarized as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Open metacarpal neck fractures (laceration extends to bone) and injuries associated with major neurovascular impairment. Such injuries are uncommon but require <strong>immediate</strong> surgical consultation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complex metacarpal neck fractures not amenable to conservative management, such as severely comminuted fractures and fractures with any rotational component. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metacarpal neck fractures with significant angulation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second (metacarpal of index finger) and third metacarpal (metacarpal of middle finger) neck fractures cannot tolerate significant angulation. Angulation &gt;10 degrees at the second metacarpal and &gt;20 degrees at the third metacarpal warrant reduction or referral. Angulation is determined using a lateral radiograph and must account for the normal metacarpal head-to-neck angle of 15 degrees. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical referral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourth and fifth metacarpal neck fractures tolerate greater angulation (up to 30 degrees). Most of these fractures result in good functional results even with significant angulation. Our preferred method for reducing metacarpal neck fractures is described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Closed reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudo-clawing (metacarpophalangeal [MCP] joint hyperextension and proximal interphalangeal [PIP] joint flexion with attempted extension of the finger) mandates fracture reduction. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Extensor apparatus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lacerations at the site of trauma (&quot;fight bites&quot;) are common and predispose to infection. Any evidence of laceration or skin breakdown requires aggressive decontamination to avoid potentially disastrous intraarticular infections. Prophylactic antibiotics appear to be beneficial with hand bites. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Skin integrity'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to human bites&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to standard fracture care, initial management of metacarpal neck fractures typically consists of immobilization in an ulnar gutter splint for fourth and fifth metacarpal neck fractures, or a radial side splint for fractures of the second and third metacarpal neck. Functional bracing with custom or off-the shelf orthoses are effective and commonly used in the definitive management of metacarpal neck fractures. Follow-up care and imaging varies according to the type of fracture and is described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metacarpal-neck-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ashkenaze DM, Ruby LK.
