The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes, and nearly always experience hypomanic and major depressive episodes. Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic episodes. Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of bipolar disorder is discussed separately.

Clinicians should ask patients about adherence behavior and attitudes in a nonjudgmental manner. One approach is to begin by stating, &ldquo;It can be difficult to always take your medication,&rdquo; and then asking, &ldquo;Have you had any problems with that?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do you think you might have problems?&rdquo; Asking about problems with adherence is thought to be more useful than simply asking whether patients are taking their medications. Additional useful questions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What time of day do you take your medications?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where do you store your medications?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How do you remember to take your medications?

Clinicians often ascribe noncompliance to incorrect reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-managing-poor-adherence-to-maintenance-pharmacotherapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Monitoring serum concentrations, which is required for some medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>) to achieve therapeutic levels and avoid toxicity, can also indicate the level of adherence. Serum concentrations of other drugs that do not have established therapeutic levels can nevertheless be assayed to check whether patients are taking any of their drugs.</p><p>The frequency of monitoring adherence depends upon the patient&rsquo;s clinical status and presumed level of adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-managing-poor-adherence-to-maintenance-pharmacotherapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A lack of response to treatment, noticeable change in symptoms, or missed appointments should prompt an assessment. In addition, well-known patients who are thought to be fully compliant are generally assessed every one to three months. Relatively new patients who regularly adhere to treatment are monitored monthly. Patients whose adherence is problematic or who are not responding to treatment are monitored weekly.</p><p>Other methods to monitor adherence include validated self-administered scales (eg, the Medication Adherence Rating Scale, which is in the public domain) and clinician administered scales (eg, the Brief Adherence Rating Scale, which is in the public domain), counting pills in the bottle, checking pharmacy records for missed refills, and electronically monitoring pill bottle caps to detect each time the bottle is opened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-managing-poor-adherence-to-maintenance-pharmacotherapy/abstract/26,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,60,61</a>].

In addition, patients are more likely to adhere to treatment if they choose the drug formulation (eg, extended release pills, sublingual tablets, transdermal patches, and liquid), frequency of doses, and timing of administration.

Common but arbitrary cutoffs for good adherence are taking at least 70 or 80 percent of prescribed doses. (See <a href=\"#H125207\" class=\"local\">'Medication adherence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many studies have found that poor adherence with pharmacotherapy occurs in roughly 50 percent of bipolar patients. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics do not necessarily improve adherence. Factors that are associated with nonadherence include comorbid substance use disorder, side effects, and patient beliefs. (See <a href=\"#H124960\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology of nonadherence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Techniques that can improve medication adherence include the following: help patients accept the diagnosis; discuss with patients their expectations of benefits and adverse effects, how the clinician will monitor the use and benefit of medications, the clinician&rsquo;s availability for questions about treatment, and plans for dose titrations; elicit benefits that are important to the patient; provide written instructions for taking prescribed medications; suggest using pill boxes and cues as a reminder to take medications; ask about the patient&rsquo;s ability to follow the regimen and address barriers to adherence; discuss the need to maintain pharmacotherapy despite feeling better; identify poor adherence; and reinforce desirable behavior. (See <a href=\"#H125281\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspects of treatment relevant to medication adherence include developing a therapeutic alliance, monitoring adherence, customizing pharmacotherapy, providing access to the clinician, and managing negative expectations. (See <a href=\"#H122826749\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic alliance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H125287\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H432432394\" class=\"local\">'Customized pharmacotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H432432759\" class=\"local\">'Access to clinicians'</a> above and <a href=\"#H86903017\" class=\"local\">'Negative expectations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Randomized trials indicate that adherence to pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder can be enhanced with group psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and family therapy. In addition, low-quality evidence suggests that motivational interviewing and customized adherence enhancement may possibly be useful.
