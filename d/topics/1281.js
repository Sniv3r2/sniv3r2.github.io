They can be very disconcerting to some patients, regardless of their insight, and can significantly decrease quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Familiarity with the disorders associated with visual hallucinations is essential to provide the appropriate care. The history, accompanying symptoms, and clinical signs are important elements for determining the most likely cause. In certain patients, further investigation may be necessary before a definitive cause can be determined.</p><p>This topic discusses the most common causes of visual hallucinations and their distinguishing features. Visual hallucinations associated with the Charles Bonnet syndrome are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=visual-release-hallucinations-charles-bonnet-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Visual release hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome)&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A visual hallucination is a perception of an external visual stimulus where none exists. In contrast, a visual illusion is a distortion or modification of real external visual stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Examples of visual illusions include distortions of size (micropsia or macropsia), shape (metamorphopsia), and color (dyschromatopsia). Visual hallucinations and illusions are clinically distinct phenomena, but have overlapping etiologies.</p><p>A useful classification scheme categorizes hallucinations as simple or complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Classifying the hallucination as simple or complex can narrow the differential diagnosis for the underlying cause.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simple hallucinations are also referred to as &quot;elementary&quot; or &quot;non-formed.&quot; They do not include complex imagery. Examples include lights, colors, lines, shapes, or geometric designs. Simple hallucinations of light can be further classified as phosphenes, which are visual hallucinations of lights without structure, and photopsias, which are visual hallucinations of lights with geometric-like structure (triangles, diamonds, squares).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex hallucinations can include images of people, animals, objects, or a lifelike scene. Complex hallucinations are also referred to as &quot;formed.&quot;</p><p/><p>Another classification scheme divides visual hallucinations into irritative phenomena that result in brief stereotyped hallucinations, and release hallucinations that are continuous and variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This classification scheme is somewhat limited because the generalizations are not absolute, and some disorders have characteristics of both types. As an example, in migraine, visual hallucinations can be stereotyped and brief, or variable and continuous. Hallucinations associated with peduncular hallucinosis are often brief, but the content tends to be variable and not stereotyped.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of various causes of visual hallucinations are summarized in the table and are discussed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73106\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73106 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Retinal pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traction, irritation, injury, or disease of the retina can stimulate retinal photoreceptors, causing simple hallucinations in the form of flashes, sparks, or streaks of light.</p><p>A posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) producing traction on the retina is a common cause of retinal hallucinations, particularly in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other potential retinal causes are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82416 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Hallucinations associated with retinal pathology are never complex. Insight is intact. Intrinsic motion is a common feature of the hallucinations of light; patients often describe flashes or flashing, whirls, shooting, lightning-like, or spinning pinwheels. In many cases, the condition and the hallucinations are monocular, but some conditions (eg, cancer-associated retinopathy) can affect both retinas concomitantly, producing binocular hallucinations. The hallucination can occur in any area of the visual field. In cases of retinal traction, valsalva-like maneuvers may be a trigger.</p><p>The duration of the hallucination is usually measured in seconds. The frequency is variable. While some patients experience multiple, brief hallucinations with waxing and waning frequency throughout the day, others may experience only one to three events prior to presentation. More frequent or persistent retinal hallucinations are associated with certain types of acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) and with cancer-associated retinopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In contrast, patients with PVD are likely to present with only a few episodes.</p><p>If a scotoma (a circumscribed area of decreased vision) develops after the onset of simple hallucinations, this can indicate a retinal injury that may become permanent if not evaluated and treated promptly (eg, retinal detachment). In addition to vision loss, the symptoms of retinal injury include seeing shadows or having distorted, warped, or blurred vision.</p><p>All hallucinations suspected to be of retinal origin should prompt an urgent evaluation by an ophthalmologist to ensure that the retina is intact (ie, no tears, holes, detachments). If the retinal examination is normal, but other signs and symptoms suggest retinal disease, then occult retinal disorders such as cancer-associated retinopathy or certain types of AZOOR could be responsible. A formal visual field test, electroretinogram, and serum studies for antibodies against retinal proteins (eg, recoverin or enolase) may be useful in revealing a cause of retinal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-visual-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic visual syndromes&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vision loss (Release hallucinations or Charles Bonnet syndrome)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visual acuity loss or visual field loss from any cause, affecting the eye, optic nerve, chiasm, or tract, optic radiations, or the visual cortex, can cause visual hallucinations, often referred to as release hallucinations or Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>CBS is most often reported in elderly patients, reflecting the mean age of the most common underlying conditions: age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and cerebral infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. Cognitive impairment and social deprivation may be risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/12,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15-19</a>].</p><p>These visual hallucinations can be simple or complex. Features that help distinguish CBS from psychosis are the absence of auditory or somatosensory hallucinations and other abnormal thought content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Because the hallucinations tend to occur in the area of vision loss, they can be monocular or binocular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> restricted to one segment of the visual field. Most patients report a duration of several minutes, but they can last less than one minute or be continuous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/1,9,14,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,14,16,20</a>]. While the majority of patients experience hallucinations multiple times a day or week, some patients experience only a few isolated episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/1,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,14</a>]. Insight is usually retained.</p><p>Patients without known ocular disease require an ophthalmologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic evaluation to determine the underlying cause of vision loss. CBS is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=visual-release-hallucinations-charles-bonnet-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Visual release hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Migraine aura</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 15 percent of individuals with migraine experience aura. Visual aura is the most common type of aura, occurring in 90 percent of people with migraine aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Most studies estimate the lifetime prevalence of visual aura of migraine to be between 0.7 to 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of migraine aura is not well understood, but is believed to be related to a phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression, a self-propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization that spreads across the cerebral cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults#H130649620\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2559114428\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Migrainous visual hallucinations are usually simple and typically linear or geometric (eg, zig zag lines) in appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The classic visual aura is the fortification spectra, which is considered pathognomonic for migraine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59061\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59061 \">figure 1</a>). A scintillating scotoma is another common migraine aura; this is an area of decreased vision that is outlined by a hallucination with geometric design. Patients also describe seeing spots, dots, or shooting stars. Migraine auras tend to be black and white or monochromatic, and are more geometric and linear in shape compared with epileptic visual hallucinations, which are more often colorful and circular or spherical in appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Migraine aura can also include vision loss and visual distortions, such as the appearance of heat waves and tunnel vision. Objects may appear smaller or larger (micropsia and macropsia) or with distorted contours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Complex visual hallucinations are uncommon, but have been described in migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]. Patients with migrainous visual hallucinations retain insight, almost without exception.</p><p>All migraine hallucinations are believed to be binocular. It is unclear if monocular visual hallucinations of migraine truly exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, many patients report monocular symptoms, likely misinterpreting binocular, homonymous visual field hallucinations as occurring only in the ipsilateral eye.</p><p>Migrainous visual hallucinations can occur in any area of the visual field, but commonly begin in the central portion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Growth or spread of the aura, often from the center to the periphery of the visual field, occurring over a few minutes is a common feature of migraine that helps distinguish it from seizure (in which spread occurs more rapidly, over a few seconds) and retinal hallucinations (which do not tend to grow or spread) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/28,30,31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,31,34</a>]. A minority of migrainous visual auras are abrupt in onset.</p><p>The usual duration for migraine aura is between 4 and 60 minutes, contrasting with the usually much briefer duration of retinal or epileptic hallucinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/28,30,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,34,35</a>]. More prolonged migrainous visual auras are less common; however, some case series have described patients with persistent visual aura of migraine that lasts months or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>].</p><p>The frequency of migraine aura is highly variable. It is rare for these to occur multiple times a day. Some patients experience only one episode in a lifetime.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3383728417\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common associated symptoms include headache and other features of migraine: nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. These follow the aura in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Headache is neither sensitive nor specific for migraine as it is also a common postictal feature of occipital epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Also, isolated visual hallucinations without headache that are presumed to be of migraine origin are common; these are often called acephalgic migraine, migraine accompaniments, or migraine aura without headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Up to one-third of patients with visual migraine aura experience other aura symptoms such as motor and sensory deficits or aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,34</a>].

In one study, a rating scale of five clinical features (duration of 5 to 60 minutes, gradual onset over 5 minutes or more, scotoma, zig-zag lines, and visual field lateralization) distinguished 362 patients with migraine aura from 108 patients with other forms of visual disturbance with a sensitivity and specificity of 91 and 96 percent respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) criteria for migraine aura require at least two attacks of aura with fully reversible symptoms, of either visual, sensory, motor, brainstem or speech disturbance, with at least two of the following features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least one aura symptom spreads gradually over &ge;5 minutes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> two or more symptoms occur in succession</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each individual aura symptom lasts 5 to 60 minutes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least one aura symptom is unilateral</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aura is accompanied, or followed within 60 minutes, by headache</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults#H21674113\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H699659606\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of migraine headache with aura is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute treatment of migraine in adults&quot;</a>).

The classification may have localizing value. In a study of 20 patients, simple visual hallucinations localized to the occipital, occipitotemporal, and occipitoparietal regions of the cortex, while complex hallucinations localized to the occipitotemporal region and the temporal lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Complex visual hallucinations did not occur in seizures restricted to the occipital lobe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Seizures arising from the occipital lobe are often associated with brightly colored circles or spherical patterns that may be multiplied or grow in size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59850 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/17,40,46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,40,46-50</a>]. Motion is a frequent characteristic of epileptic hallucinations. The motion can be intrinsic to the hallucination, or the entire hallucination can move rapidly (usually in seconds) across the visual field in the direction contralateral to the seizure focus. Visual field deficits or blindness may also occur, and some patients also note visual illusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/46,47,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47,49,50</a>]. As with other epileptic phenomena, ictal visual hallucinations are usually stereotyped.</p><p>Epileptic hallucinations are binocular, usually occurring in one hemifield or the other, however, some patients misinterpret bilateral, homonymous visual field hallucinations as existing in only the ipsilateral eye. Insight in patients with epilepsy is typically, but not always, intact.</p><p>Epileptic hallucinations are usually brief, only a few seconds, unless the seizures are continuous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/40,47,48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,47,48,50</a>]. The brief duration is especially true of idiopathic occipital epilepsy and is a differentiating feature from migraine hallucinations, which are longer in duration. The frequency is variable, but episodes tend to occur more frequently than do migraines; daily or weekly events are more common than less frequent occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/47,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50</a>]. Episodes are generally not provoked.</p><p>Although many visual seizures do not progress to other ictal manifestations, nearly all patients experience nonvisual epileptic symptoms at some time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/17,47,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,47,49-51</a>].

Associated symptoms depend on the origin and spread of the seizure and can include deja vu, somatosensory phenomena, head and eye deviation, motor activity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired consciousness. Postictal headache is common in patients with occipital epilepsy and does not help to differentiate seizures from migrainous visual hallucinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations/abstract/47,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,50,51</a>].</p><p>For patients suspected of having seizures, a complete neurologic evaluation and an electroencephalogram (EEG) should be performed.
