It is usually a lifelong disorder that begins in childhood and is fully manifest by the late 20s or early 30s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Typical behaviors include criminality and failure to conform to the law, failure to sustain consistent employment, manipulation of others for personal gain, and failure to develop stable interpersonal relationships. Other features of ASPD include lacking empathy for others, rarely experiencing remorse, and failing to learn from the negative results of one&rsquo;s experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>This topic describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder.

Sociopathy is a lay term that is essentially synonymous with antisocial personality disorder, and has been used less over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335149172\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychopathy has been described as a clinical construct distinct from ASPD, defined by a constellation of antisocial behaviors and psychological symptoms, such as lack of emotional connection with others and an incapacity for guilt or remorse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In contrast, except for &ldquo;lacking remorse,&rdquo; the DSM-5 criteria for ASPD are mainly focused on observable behavioral manifestations. Psychopathy indicates a particularly malignant form of ASPD and appears to fall at the severe end of the antisocial behavior spectrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most psychopaths meet criteria for ASPD, but not all ASPD patients are psychopathic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335149180\"><span class=\"h2\">Conduct disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ASPD overlaps conceptually and diagnostically with conduct disorder, a mental disorder of childhood and adolescence. Conduct disorder is diagnosed in children and adolescents with a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior violating basic rights of others or major societal norms or rules. While the majority of children with conduct disorder do not develop adult ASPD, they are at risk to do so, with an estimated 25 percent of girls and 40 percent of boys eventually developing ASPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31582471\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large epidemiologic surveys conducted in the United States and United Kingdom have shown that 2 to 5 percent of the adult population met criteria for lifetime antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Based on these data, men have greater risk of ASPD than do women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an example, in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) study, the risk of ASPD was 3 times greater among men than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) survey of five United States cities found 2 to 4 percent of men and 0.5 to 1 percent of women met these criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Two nationally representative surveys of United States adults, the National Comorbidity Study and the NESARC study, estimated prevalence rates of 3.5 and 3.6 percent, respectively; the latter survey found a rate of 5.5 percent for men and 1.9 percent for women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The British National Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity reported a prevalence of 2.9 percent for ASPD in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H237333\"><span class=\"h2\">Special settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survey results may underestimate the prevalence of ASPD in the general population because they lack data on institutionalized and incarcerated persons. A study conducted in the in the United States adult prison population in the 1970s found that as many as 80 percent of incarcerated men and 65 percent of incarcerated women had ASPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Data suggest that the prevalence of ASPD in prisons in the United States may have declined over the past decade as the prison population has increased and sentencing laws have become harsher. As an example, only 35 percent of prisoners assessed with a structured instrument in 2010 were diagnosed with ASPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p>Studies have found a high prevalence of ASPD among certain patient groups. As examples, the prevalence of ASPD in alcoholic patients has ranged between 16 percent and 49 percent, and the prevalence for ASPD among individuals dependent on heroin and drugs is even higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Homelessness is associated with the presence of ASPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], which may reflect impoverishment related to a poor work record, inability to fulfill obligations (eg, rent payments), or because of co-occurring substance misuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H237326\"><span class=\"h2\">Socioeconomic correlates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ASPD is associated with low socioeconomic status, which can be attributed in part to poor educational achievement, poor job performance, and frequent unemployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the NESARC study, respondents with lower educational levels and lower income levels were at increased risk for ASPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Low social class itself is not responsible for ASPD. A study of African-American youth found that children without antisocial symptoms were not at risk for ASPD even when they were raised in impoverished homes, but children with high rates of antisocial symptoms were at risk for ASPD even when reared in homes with a higher socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Surveys have found higher rates of ASPD among younger compared to older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Elements of family dysfunction in the studies included a member of the adoptive family with ASPD, divorced adoptive parents, and low socioeconomic status in the adoptive home. </p><p/><p>An analysis of data on 1,048 male and female twins found that three &ldquo;externalizing disorders&rdquo; (substance misuse, ASPD, and &ldquo;disinhibited personality&rdquo;) shared a common heritability, with a measure of heritability of 0.81 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A study of 2794 Norwegian twins found that a highly heritable (51 percent) common factor could account for the correlations among the seven section A ASPD criteria, thereby supporting its validity as a diagnostic construct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

This research supports the hypothesis that the disorders may share common genetic risks with environmental factors, influencing which, if any, disorder may develop. </p><p>A study of the molecular genetics of antisocial behavior examined variants of a gene influencing levels of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In a large sample of abused children, 85 percent of children with a low-activity variant of the gene exhibited antisocial behavior in adulthood. In contrast, children who experienced similar abuse but had a high-activity variant of the gene rarely exhibited antisocial behaviors in adulthood. Another study, of male twins, found that low activity of the MAO-A gene increased the risk for conduct disorder in the presence of childhood adversity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104021823\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurodevelopment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autonomic underarousal has been proposed as underlying psychopathy for a subset of individuals who experience ASPD with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This model posits that psychopathic persons require greater sensory input to produce normal brain functioning than in normal subjects, possibly leading these individuals to seek potentially dangerous or risky situations to raise their level of arousal to more desired levels.

Data interpretation is complicated by the considerable heterogeneity among the studies both in terms of imaging method used and the study population. It is possible that frontal deficits (prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) contribute to impulsivity, poor judgment, and irresponsible behavior, while dysfunction in the temporal regions (amygdala-hippocampal and superior temporal cortex) predispose to antisocial features such as inability to follow rules and deficient moral judgment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104021837\"><span class=\"h2\">Family and social factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parents of persons who develop ASPD often have poor parenting skills, or are abusive or absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/4-8,10-13,20,48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8,10-13,20,48-51</a>].<sup> </sup>Parents of behaviorally troubled children exhibit higher levels of antisocial behavior themselves; in comparison to parents of children without such problems, they have higher rates of alcoholism, criminal records, divorce or separation, or absence from the child&rsquo;s life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Antisocial parents may be unlikely to effectively monitor their child&rsquo;s behavior, set rules and ensure that they are obeyed, check on the child&rsquo;s whereabouts, or steer them away from troubled playmates. </p><p>Child abuse has been reported to contribute to the development of ASPD. People with ASPD are more likely than others to report histories of childhood abuse, consistent with findings that many grew up with neglectful and sometimes violent parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In one study, 14 to 21 percent of adults who reported abusing or neglecting their children were antisocial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>In some individuals with ASPD, abusive behavior may be learned from parents and perpetuated with the individuals&rsquo; own children, leading to a cycle of abuse from one generation to another. The physical abuse of children can impact normal brain function, for example, by tearing the bridging veins within the skull through vigorously shaking a child. One theory is that physical and emotional abuse disrupts normal central nervous system development by triggering the release of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, ACTH, and glucocorticoids, thereby increasing the potential for the child to develop antisocial behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>Disturbed peer relationships are an important and often overlooked factor associated with the development of antisocial behavior. This is referred to as the &ldquo;birds of a feather&rdquo; phenomenon wherein troubled youth seek the companionship of other similarly troubled youth. As an example, one study found that 98 percent of 500 delinquent boys had delinquent friends, compared with 7 percent of 500 non-delinquent peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The delinquent boys were also more likely to report that they had been gang members (56 versus 1 percent). This pattern of association usually begins during the elementary school years. </p><p>Another study of over 200 middle school children found that youth who were attracted to antisocial peers engaged in antisocial behavior themselves in order to gain their acceptance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. While it is difficult to tease out cause and effect, these relationships can encourage and reward aggressive behavior. Gangs may be attractive to those who feel neglected by their families and peer group. </p><p>There has been concern that exposure to violent media or video games have a causal relationship with aggression and antisocial behaviors.

As an example, if the family history reveals a history consistent with ASPD in a relative, then that should raise the level of suspicion of ASPD in the patient. </p><p>Other aspects of the psychiatric examination warranting additional emphasis include the presence and history of substance use disorder. Because antisocial persons are at increased risk for suicide attempts and completed suicide, they should specifically be asked about current suicidal thoughts and past suicidal behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H237270\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychological testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological testing is usually unnecessary when sufficient history is available.

In an adult with new onset antisocial behavior, diagnostic alternatives to ASPD include temporal lobe epilepsy, which can cause random outbursts of violence, and brain tumors or strokes, which could lead to personality changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]<sup> </sup>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>ASPD is distinguishable from normal behavior. Isolated acts of misbehavior are inconsistent with the diagnosis of ASPD, which involves repetitive misbehavior over time beginning in childhood. Rather than receiving a DSM-5 diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, adults who develop criminal or antisocial behavior in the absence of childhood conduct disorder are identified by a <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Z</span> code (&ldquo;adult antisocial behavior&rdquo;), which identifies factors influencing health status and contact with health services but are not recognized psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antisocial-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31582569\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is defined as a pattern of socially irresponsible, exploitative, and guiltless behavior that begins in childhood or early adolescence. It is characterized by behaviors constituting a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, and is manifested by disturbances in many areas of life. (See <a href=\"#H335149157\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ASPD represents the adult continuation of conduct disorder, a disorder of childhood and adolescence. Conduct disorder is diagnosed in children and adolescents with a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior violating basic rights of others or major societal norms or rules. Some, but not all, children with conduct disorder meet diagnostic criteria for ASPD later in the lives. (See <a href=\"#H335149180\" class=\"local\">'Conduct disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large epidemiologic surveys have estimated that 2 to 5 percent of the adult population in the United States and United Kingdom met criteria for lifetime antisocial personality disorder. The prevalence of the disorder in men is greater than in women. (See <a href=\"#H31582471\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons with ASPD have high rates of other comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, including substance use disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), pathological gambling, and other personality disorders. Learning disorders are also common.(See <a href=\"#H237319\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of ASPD is unknown, but research suggests that both genetic and non-genetic factors are involved in its development. (See <a href=\"#H104021809\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irresponsible, exploitative, and guiltless behaviors characteristic of ASPD are seen in many areas of life, eg, family relations, school, work, military service, and marriage. They can range from relatively mild behaviors to heinous acts. (See <a href=\"#H31582478\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of ASPD includes borderline personality disorder, substance use disorders, psychoses, mania, intermittent explosive disorder, temporal lobe epilepsy, brain tumors, and strokes. (See <a href=\"#H30628237\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">North C, Yutzy S.
