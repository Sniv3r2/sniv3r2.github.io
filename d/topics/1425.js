Fetal sex and <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span> appear to play a role in this process; respiratory problems near term are more common among white male fetuses than among female fetuses, blacks, and South Asians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Because the immature pulmonary system may not oxygenate the premature neonate adequately, preterm birth can lead to significant neonatal morbidity or mortality. Fetal lung maturity is sometimes assessed before iatrogenic preterm delivery and can be a factor in determining the timing of delivery in these cases; however, this is much less common than in the past. Several laboratory tests are available for this purpose. All involve testing amniotic fluid and provide an indirect assessment of the likelihood of lung maturity; direct studies of fetal lung function are not possible.</p><p>This topic will discuss tests for assessment of fetal lung maturity. Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, sequelae, and prevention of neonatal pulmonary immaturity are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN IS FETAL LUNG MATURITY TESTING PERFORMED?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most clinical settings, testing for fetal lung maturity is not performed because (1) delaying delivery because of lung immaturity would place the mother or fetus at significant risk, or (2) the fetus would benefit from delaying delivery, even if lung maturity is documented, and delaying delivery does not place the mother at significant risk, or (3) a course of antenatal steroids can be given, which will benefit the fetus with immature lungs and has no proven harms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These assessments are not always black and white, and information about lung maturity may sometimes be helpful in the balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The information may also be helpful in estimating the level of newborn care that will be required. Thus, a test for fetal lung maturity may be performed before semielective but medically indicated births &lt;39 weeks when this information significantly impacts assessment of the balance between the maternal-fetal risks of continuing the pregnancy versus the maternal-fetal risks of preterm birth. This is an infrequent occurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H967242218\"><span class=\"h2\">When should testing be avoided?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests for fetal lung maturity are generally <strong>not</strong> performed before 32 weeks of gestation, given the high prevalence of fetal pulmonary immaturity and the lower predictive value of a mature test result at this gestational age.</p><p>Tests for fetal lung maturity are <strong>not</strong> performed in pregnancies with a reliable gestational age &ge;39 weeks. At this gestational age, fetal lung maturity can be inferred; test results are not more predictive of respiratory outcome than gestational age alone. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) considers gestational age assessment unreliable (ie, suboptimally dated pregnancy) if no ultrasound examination was performed before 22+0 weeks of gestation confirming or revising the estimated due date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. ACOG recommends <strong>not </strong>performing amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity testing in suboptimally dated pregnancies to guide timing of delivery as this decision should be based on the best clinical estimate of gestational age and standard indications for intervention, rather than results from fetal lung maturity testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In the past, fetal lung maturity testing was performed prior to elective cesarean delivery or induction at 37 or 38 weeks of gestation (eg, repeat cesarean, induction for logistical indications); however, both elective delivery at this gestational age and fetal lung testing should be avoided. Even when lung maturity test results suggest a low risk of respiratory problems, neonates delivered at 37 or 38 weeks are at higher risk of adverse outcome than those delivered at 39 to 40 weeks of gestation without fetal lung maturity testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A fetal lung maturity test consistent with maturity is not an appropriate indication for early delivery in the absence of appropriate clinical indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">FETAL MATURITY TESTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190227888\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal lung maturity is evaluated by biochemical tests or biophysical tests. Biochemical tests measure the concentration of particular components of pulmonary surfactant. Biophysical tests evaluate the surface-active effects of these phospholipids.</p><p>The choice of test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64274 \">table 1</a>) should be based upon availability, presence or absence of contaminants (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Blood, meconium'</a> below), and physician preference. Although randomized trials comparing multiple tests have not been performed, controlled studies suggest that no test in the table performed significantly better than the others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/3,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-11</a>]. All are better at predicting the absence, rather than the presence, of respiratory distress. All perform less well at earlier gestational ages, which should be taken into account when interpreting results.</p><p>If the first test performed on an amniotic fluid sample is immature, we suggest not performing a second different test on the same sample, as medicolegal issues may arise if the neonate is delivered after discordant results and develops respiratory problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93483124\"><span class=\"h2\">Lamellar body count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is the test generally used for assessing fetal lung maturity in the United States. The other tests described below are no longer available in commercial laboratories, but may be available in some hospital laboratories. Lamellar body counts are a direct measurement of surfactant production by type-II pneumocytes. A standard hematology analyzer (eg, Coulter LH 750, Coulter Ac.T diff, Sysmex XE-2100) can be used for quantification because of the similar size of lamellar bodies and platelets. Values less than 15,000 per microliter are almost always associated with lung immaturity; values &ge;50,000 per microliter strongly suggest lung maturity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. However, there is no consensus on the optimal threshold for predicting lung maturity; values greater than 30,000 to 40,000 per microliter, as well as higher levels, have been suggested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64274 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. As with all tests of fetal lung maturity, gestational age affects the positive predictive value (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Gestational age'</a> below). Gestational-age specific lamellar body count cutoffs for risk assessment of&nbsp;fetal&nbsp;lung&nbsp;maturity are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>].</p><p>Some clinicians use the lamellar body count as an initial screening test and perform the <span class=\"nowrap\">lecithin/sphingomyelin</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(L/S)</span> ratio if the lamellar body count is neither clearly mature (&ge;50,000 per microliter) nor immature (&lt;30,000 per microliter). </p><p>Compared with thin-layer chromatography techniques, the lamellar body count is faster, more objective, less labor intensive, less technique dependent, and less expensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In meta-analyses, the lamellar body count performed as well or slightly better than the <span class=\"nowrap\">lecithin/sphingomyelin</span> ratio in predicting respiratory distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The lamellar body count performs as well as the formerly available TDx-FLM II (see <a href=\"#H23142545\" class=\"local\">'Surfactant/albumin ratio'</a> below); both perform best when interpreted according to gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Blood contamination can lead to false elevation of the lamellar body count because platelets are counted as lamellar bodies; the effect of meconium is minimal.</p><p>All laboratories need to establish their own cutoffs for lamellar body count since hematology analyzers vary in sensitivity and gain settings. Establishing internal quality control is also important for this test. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute provides guidance for the use of automated cell counting to count lamellar bodies in amniotic fluid. The document &ldquo;Assessment of Fetal Lung Maturity by the Lamellar Body Count (C58-A)&rdquo; provides guidelines for the use of automated cell counting to perform lamellar body counts, describes methods to assist in test verification and validation, and describes methods to select an appropriate maturity cutoff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Phosphatidylglycerol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is a minor constituent of surfactant. It begins to increase appreciably in amniotic fluid after 35 weeks, several weeks after the rise in lecithin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Because PG enhances the spread of phospholipids in the alveoli, its presence indicates an advanced state of fetal lung development and function.</p><p>PG testing can be performed by thin-layer chromatography, so it can be determined alone or in conjunction with testing for the <span class=\"nowrap\">lecithin/sphingomyelin</span> ratio. It may be reported qualitatively as positive or negative, where positive represents an exceedingly low risk of respiratory distress, or quantitatively, where a thin-layer chromatography value &gt;2 percent is associated with a minimal rate of respiratory distress (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64274 \">table 1</a>)[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Because thin-layer chromatography is a complicated and time-consuming technique, a rapid, semiquantitative immunologic slide agglutination test (AmnioStat-FLM) and several enzymatic assays were developed and have been validated as acceptable alternative techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. The slide agglutination test is the most common method for testing for PG; however, it appears to be less sensitive for detecting fetal lung maturity than thin-layer chromatography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>An advantage of testing for PG is that blood or meconium usually does not affect test results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A disadvantage is that the absence of PG, especially before 36 weeks of gestation, is less predictive of the occurrence of respiratory distress than immature results from other tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1700429375\"><span class=\"h2\">Lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">lecithin/sphingomyelin</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(L/S)</span> ratio is based upon the observation that there is outward flow of lung secretions from the lungs into the amniotic fluid. This process changes the phospholipid composition of amniotic fluid, thereby enabling indirect assessment of fetal lung maturity through evaluation of this fluid.</p><p>The concentrations of lecithin and sphingomyelin in amniotic fluid are approximately equal until 32 to 33 weeks of gestation, at which time the concentration of lecithin begins to increase significantly while the sphingomyelin concentration remains about the same. The measurement of sphingomyelin serves as a constant comparison for control of the relative increases in lecithin because the volume of amniotic fluid cannot be accurately measured clinically.</p><p>Determining the <span class=\"nowrap\">lecithin/sphingomyelin</span> ratio involves thin-layer chromatography after organic solvent extraction. It is a technically difficult test to perform and interpret; care at each step of sample handling is critical for consistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The sample should be kept on ice or refrigerated if transport to a laboratory is required (most laboratories cannot perform this test). Improper storage conditions can change the <span class=\"nowrap\">lecithin/sphingomyelin</span> ratio since amniotic fluid contains enzymes that can be affected by temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The amniotic fluid sample must be well mixed before testing. It takes several hours to perform the test and may take 24 hours when both transport and testing time are considered, which is another disadvantage of this method.</p><p>Individual laboratories should calculate a threshold value for predicting lung maturity by correlating their test results with clinical outcome as the variation within and between laboratories can be considerable. Empirically, the risk of respiratory distress is exceedingly low when the <span class=\"nowrap\">lecithin/sphingomyelin</span> ratio is greater than 2.0 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64274 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1159561295\"><span class=\"h2\">Optical density at 650 nm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An indirect measurement of lamellar bodies can be obtained by measuring the optical density of amniotic fluid at a wavelength of 650 nanometers. It is based upon the concept that increasing opalescence is due to increasing numbers of lamellar bodies. An optical density reading &ge;0.15 is used as the indicator of lung maturity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2888059142\"><span class=\"h2\">Foam stability index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The foam stability index (FSI) assesses total surfactant activity. It is a rapid predictor of fetal lung maturity based upon the ability of surfactant to generate stable foam in the presence of ethanol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Ethanol is added to a sample of amniotic fluid to eliminate the effects of nonsurfactant factors on foam formation. The mixture is then shaken and will generate a stable ring of foam if surfactant is present. The FSI is calculated by utilizing serial dilutions of ethanol to quantitate the amount of surfactant present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Amniotic fluid samples for FSI should not be collected in silicone tubes, as the silicone will produce &quot;false foam.&quot; The discriminating value indicative of lung maturity is usually set at &ge;47. A positive result virtually excludes the risk of respiratory distress; however, a negative test often occurs with mature lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The presence of blood or meconium interferes with results of the FSI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23142545\"><span class=\"h2\">Surfactant/albumin ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">surfactant/albumin</span> ratio also assesses total surfactant activity. Currently, there are no commercially available tests for measuring this ratio.</p><p>The TDx-FLM II was a commercially available test for measuring the <span class=\"nowrap\">surfactant/albumin</span> ratio. It was based on the principle of fluorescence polarization and used an automated analyzer to quantitate the competitive binding of a fluorescent probe to both surfactant and albumin in a sample of amniotic fluid; thus, it was a true direct measurement of surfactant concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. An elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">surfactant/albumin</span> ratio correlated with fetal lung maturity; the threshold for maturity was 55 mg of surfactant per gram albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Test performance compared favorably with the well-established <span class=\"nowrap\">lecithin/sphingomyelin</span> ratio and PG tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64274 \">table 1</a>) and was gestational age dependent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72799 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/10,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,38,39</a>].</p><p>Advantages of the TDx-FLM II were that it was a simple, automated, rapid test that varied minimally between laboratories and required only a small volume of amniotic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A disadvantage was the large quantification scale: Values greater than 55 were considered mature, and values less than 40 were considered immature, while values of 40 to 54 were considered &quot;indeterminate&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/3,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,38</a>]. Blood or meconium in the amniotic fluid also affected results.</p><p>The manufacturer retired the analytical systems for the TDx-FLM II test and ended production of the reagent required to perform it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT INTERPRETATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Gestational age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For each test, the ability to predict respiratory distress is influenced by the prevalence of respiratory distress in the population tested; thus, the predictive value varies with gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/11,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,40,41</a>]. For example, in one analysis, the risk of respiratory distress after a TDx-FLM II of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> at 29 and 37 weeks of gestation was 16 and 1 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

It is not useful as a component of delivery timing decision-making in pregnancies with well-documented gestational age &ge;39 weeks (because lung maturity is likely), pregnancies less than 32 weeks of gestation (because lung immaturity is likely), and when delivery is <span class=\"nowrap\">obstetrically/medically</span> indicated (because delaying delivery will place the mother or fetus at significant risk). If a pregnancy is suboptimally dated (no ultrasound examination before 22+0<sup> </sup>weeks), timing of delivery should be based on the best clinical estimate of gestational age and standard indications for intervention; fetal lung maturity testing is not recommended as a component of decision-making. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'When is fetal lung maturity testing performed?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test for fetal lung maturity may be performed before semielective but medically indicated births &lt;39 weeks when this information significantly impacts assessment of the balance between the maternal-fetal risks of continuing the pregnancy versus the maternal-fetal risks of preterm birth. This is an infrequent occurrence. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'When is fetal lung maturity testing performed?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal lung maturity can be assessed by testing for components of fetal lung secretions in amniotic fluid. No test performs significantly better than another, and all are better at predicting the absence, rather than the presence, of respiratory distress. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fetal maturity tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of test should be based upon availability, presence or absence of contaminants, and physician preference. A summary of the different tests available and the assets and liabilities associated with each is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64274 \">table 1</a>). The lamellar body count is the test generally used for assessing fetal lung maturity in the United States. The other tests in the table are no longer available in commercial laboratories, but may be available in some hospital laboratories. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fetal maturity tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest performing only one test for fetal lung maturity on an amniotic fluid sample. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fetal maturity tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational age is an important factor in interpreting tests of fetal lung maturity. All tests perform less well at earlier gestational ages, which should be taken into account when interpreting results. Gestational age-specific tables for prediction of respiratory distress have been published. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Gestational age'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or meconium in amniotic fluid affects some test results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64274 \">table 1</a>). Oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, and source of amniotic fluid (vaginal pool versus amniocentesis) can also affect results. The same threshold value for lung maturity can be used for both nondiabetic and diabetic patients (pregestational or gestational diabetes). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Factors that may affect interpretation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-fetal-lung-maturity/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Balchin I, Whittaker JC, Lamont RF, Steer PJ.
