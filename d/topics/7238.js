Bronchoscopy is particularly helpful when pneumonia is suspected on the basis of an abnormal chest radiograph and symptoms or signs of pneumonia (eg, fever, cough), but the patient cannot produce sputum for collection (eg, mycobacterial species) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The value of bronchoscopic sampling in patients who can produce sputum for analysis is controversial and uncertain.

The purpose of bronchoscopy is to identify (eg, malignant endobronchial obstruction) or remove any obstructing lesion (eg, mucus plug, foreign body).

Diagnostic specimens can be collected for cytopathological analysis by washing, brushing, BAL, or biopsy. The extent of extrinsic compression of the airway from the mass if present can also be assessed as well as direct sampling of peribronchial masses with transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA). Flexible bronchoscopy alone is much less useful for smaller peripheral nodules. Transbronchial biopsy, biopsy of peripheral nodules and use of cryobiopsy are discussed separately.

In mild or moderate hemoptysis, the bleeding may be controlled with local treatment using laser, APC, balloon tamponade, or selective occlusion of the suspected bronchus with a blockade catheter. Even if the source of bleeding cannot be identified, flexible bronchoscopy may localize the area of bleeding for angiographic embolization, or surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Flexible bronchoscopy is helpful in assessing the patency of the airways, confirming airway obstruction and identifying the cause. Ultrathin bronchoscopes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F94870\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94870 \">picture 1</a>) can be used to examine the distal airways beyond a high grade obstruction without compromising the ventilation critically.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of central airway obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tracheobronchomalacia</strong> &ndash; Flexible bronchoscopy is used to examine the mechanical properties of the airways. Bronchoscopic documentation of dynamic airway collapse in suspected patients is the gold standard for diagnosing tracheomalacia and tracheobronchomalacia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Flexible bronchoscopy is also done to evaluate the donor lung prior to harvesting to rule out any infection or laceration from trauma and can also be used to evaluate suspected tracheal stenosis at the anastomosis site. The value of surveillance bronchoscopy is controversial.

Airway lacerations that follow blunt chest trauma generally involve the membranous distal trachea or proximal main stem bronchi. Bronchoscopy is done to localize and determine the severity of any airway laceration or injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Small injuries may be managed conservatively (ie, by placing the end of the endotracheal tube distal to the laceration under bronchoscopic guidance to minimize airway pressures), but severe injuries require surgical repair.

The initial diagnostic evaluation of a suspected tracheoesophageal fistula generally involves an upper gastrointestinal imaging series with contrast. However, flexible bronchoscopy is performed to confirm and identify the exact location and extent of the fistula to determine appropriate management options. Administration of a contrast agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>) into the esophagus during bronchoscopy may help identify the tracheoesophageal fistula in certain cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In contrast, bronchoscopy may not be helpful in identifying the exact location of a bronchopleural fistula following transbronchial lung biopsy, thoracentesis, or attempted central venous catheter insertion; because the bronchoscope cannot visualize the peripheral airways or lung, it may assist in localizing the involved lobe or subsegment with the help of selective balloon inflation to direct further intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluate complications or placement of artificial airways</strong> &ndash; Flexible bronchoscopy is performed to assess any tracheal damage or ventilation difficulties (eg, obstruction from mucus or blood clot, ulceration, stenosis, cuff leaks, tube migration) in patients with tracheostomy or endotracheal tubes.

By applying electrical current through the probe, tracheobronchial tissue or endobronchial tumor can be coagulated within the airways. Some electrocautery probes have metallic wired snares to cut and cauterize simultaneously to minimize bleeding from removal of a polypoid endobronchial mass.

As liquid nitrogen is passed through the catheter, the metallic tip of the probe is cooled. When placed in contact with the target tissue, this causes protein denaturation leading to cellular death. The tissue is destroyed by repeated freezing and thawing. Cryotherapy along with flexible bronchoscopy is often used to remove certain foreign bodies that have organic content.

Radiation oncologists later insert the radioactive pellet through the catheter adjacent to the targeted malignant tissue during the treatment session. The radioactive pellets emit short range, high dose local radiotherapy to destroy the surrounding tumor cells in the airway without much damage to the lung parenchyma.

The stents are most commonly placed in conjunction with ablative therapies or balloon bronchoplasty. Rigid bronchoscopy is required for silicone stent placement. During follow up after stent placement, surveillance flexible bronchoscopy is used periodically to clean both metallic and silicone stents and rule out stent migration.

In certain circumstances, the risk factors may be optimized prior to the procedure to avoid any impending complications. For example, severe hypoxemia is a contraindication to bronchoscopy. However, a patient may be intubated specifically for bronchoscopy to minimize the risk of periprocedural hypoxemia at the known expense of exposing the patient to all the attendant complications of intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Although severe hypoxemia has been considered an absolute contraindication, if the treatment decision is felt to significantly depend on the results of the bronchoscopy or if it is considered to be therapeutic (eg, mucus plug removal), bronchoscopy may be performed either on noninvasive ventilation or with laryngeal mask airway (LMA) placement with the informed consent clearly stating the risk of impending respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Although no one required intubation immediately after bronchoscopy, 10 percent were intubated in the subsequent eight hours and 45 percent within 48 hours.

There may be complete obstruction of ventilation when a bronchoscope is passed through the obstructed airway. However, if an intervention is planned to treat the condition, bronchoscopy can and should be performed provided adequate pre-procedure planning is done to address any procedural complications. Limiting the duration of bronchoscopic examination or intervention will also permit adequate ventilation and oxygenation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe pulmonary hypertension</strong> &ndash; Bronchoscopy, and in particular, transbronchial biopsy, in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) is traditionally considered high risk. Risks include bleeding from transbronchial biopsy as well as hemodynamic compromise secondary to both sedation and increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure during bronchoscopy and possible requirement for mechanical ventilation post procedure. Pulmonary hypertension is defined as mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) &gt;25 mmHg. This assessment is largely based upon clinical experience and the logic that capillary pressure is constantly elevated in this group. There is no absolute cut-off point in pulmonary pressure over which bronchoscopy becomes unsafe. However, in general, we prefer to avoid bronchoscopy in patients with untreated PH.

Premedication with nebulized bronchodilator and optimization of asthma control can minimize the risks of bronchospasm or hypoxia. Patients may benefit from CPAP or positive pressure ventilation during recovery from sedation. Transbronchial biopsy should be avoided in COPD patients with bullous disease due to the higher than usual risk of pneumothorax. Nonemergent elective bronchoscopy should be avoided in patients who are currently having or have had an exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the prior six weeks. Oxygen supplementation during bronchoscopy should be avoided or used with caution in those where the pre-bronchoscopy partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide is raised.

The suction time should be limited to less than two to three seconds to minimize loss of tidal volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In support of this approach, a retrospective study of 38 patients who underwent BAL and transbronchial biopsy on mechanical ventilation to evaluate pulmonary infiltrate, reported etiologic diagnosis obtained in 63 percent with an increased rate of pneumothorax (9 of 38) without any fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Large anterior mediastinal masses</strong> &ndash; Bulky lymphadenopathy or large masses of the anterior mediastinum may compress and block the airway during sedation. It may be difficult to ventilate these patients during the procedure or post recovery resulting in respiratory failure and intubation. While some clinicians prefer deep sedation or general anesthesia in such cases, one case report describes the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexmedetomidine</a> (avoids muscle relaxation; awake intubation) for the performance of bronchoscopic procedures on anterior mediastinal masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Thus, in this population we prefer performing bronchoscopy in a sitting position with spontaneous respiration. An awake bronchoscopy with topical sedation or regional anesthesia (glossopharyngeal block) may also be an acceptable alternative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; Decrease in residual volume and expiratory reserve volume along with an increased demand of oxygen by the fetus and the placenta during pregnancy may lead to rapid oxygen desaturation during bronchoscopy. Medications used for sedation also may pose an adverse risk to the fetus. Nonemergent bronchoscopy should be postponed until delivery or at least after 28 weeks of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, if it is considered lifesaving (acute airway obstruction or massive hemoptysis) and needs to be performed during pregnancy, bronchoscopy should be preferably done in the operating room with anesthesia and an obstetrician available with continuous fetal monitoring. Placement in the left lateral decubitus position and oral approach (if not intubated) will minimize risks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Older patients</strong> &ndash; Flexible bronchoscopy is safe in the older adult population. The predominant risk may be oversedation. A retrospective study showed that the use of supplemental oxygen, rate of fever, hypertension, or bleeding were not significantly different between those &gt;75 years and those between 50 and 75 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients requiring prophylactic antibiotics</strong> &ndash; The value of prophylactic antibiotics in patients who typically require them for other procedures is unknown. Some clinicians advocate for their use in patients who are asplenic, have a mechanical heart valve prosthesis, or who have a history of endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, the value of the practice is of unclear benefit. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H288135592\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common diagnostic indications for bronchoscopy include the evaluation of pneumonia or infiltrates of unclear etiology as well as the evaluation of hemoptysis, sampling of lung masses, nodules, or mediastinal lymph nodes to diagnose malignancy, the evaluation and diagnosis of endobronchial foreign bodies, tracheoesophageal fistula, tracheobronchomalacia, and endobronchial lacerations, and the evaluation of cough and airway complications of artificial airways. (See <a href=\"#H288135472\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common therapeutic uses include the removal of excess mucus or foreign body from the airways; endotracheal tube placement in difficult airways; endoluminal tumor debulking with laser, APC, cryotherapy, or electrocautery; balloon bronchoplasty; surveillance of tracheobronchial stents; bronchial thermoplasty; or endobronchial valve placement. (See <a href=\"#H288135479\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absolute contraindications for bronchoscopy are absent informed consent, severe refractory hypoxia with inability to maintain adequate oxygenation during the procedure, or malfunctioning equipment. Other contraindications to flexible bronchoscopy include those at risk of respiratory and cardiovascular decompensation as well as those at risk of bleeding during bronchoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H927707\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific contraindications to flexible bronchoscopy include those with severe hypoxemia (but responsive to increasing fraction of inspired oxygen), exacerbation of asthma, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe pulmonary hypertension, current or recent myocardial ischemia, poorly controlled heart failure, life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"#H288135501\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexible bronchoscopy is also contraindicated in those patients who are at risk of bleeding including those on anticoagulants or who have a coagulopathy that cannot be reversed, patients with renal insufficiency, and occasionally those with superior vena cava syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H288135543\" class=\"local\">'Patients at risk of bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flexible bronchoscopy is a high risk procedure in select populations, but can be performed safely with certain provisions. As examples, flexible bronchoscopy can be performed in patients with raised intracranial pressure preferably under deep sedation or general anesthesia. Non-emergent bronchoscopy should be delayed in pregnancy until after delivery or at least after 28 weeks of gestation but can be performed for emergent indications preferably under general anesthesia. Additional precautions should be considered in those on mechanical ventilation, in those with large anterior mediastinal masses, and in older adults. (See <a href=\"#H928053\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">van der Eerden MM, Vlaspolder F, de Graaff CS, et al.
