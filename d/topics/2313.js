The <span class=\"nowrap\">cryoprobe/forceps</span> is used to freeze the target tissue. The transfer line connects the <span class=\"nowrap\">cryoprobe/forceps</span> to both the cooling agent storage container (eg, gas cylinder) and the console.

It is stored in the liquid state at room temperature in high-pressure bottles. The vapor haze of N<sub>2</sub>O occurs at the metal tip of the cryoprobe, where it expands as it goes from high pressure to atmospheric pressure. This expansion lowers the temperature of the fluid (via the Joule-Thomson effect) and produces droplets of liquid. The result is an equilibrium temperature of -89&ordm;C in the distal two centimeters of the cryoprobe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Liquid nitrogen</strong> &ndash; Liquid nitrogen (LN<sub>2</sub>) is stored near its saturation temperature of -196&ordm;C in vacuum-insulated containers. It evaporates as it passes through the transfer line at room temperature, leaving gaseous nitrogen to slowly cool the metal tip of the cryoprobe (the temperature of -196&ordm;C is reached in about one minute). Once the temperature in the transfer line becomes sufficiently low, evaporation is prevented and droplets of LN2 bombard the inner wall of the metal tip of the cryoprobe, cooling the cryoprobe at a more rapid rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-cryotechniques-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p>Choosing among these agents is often dependent upon availability, clinician experience, and institutional biases. While research data are not available, most clinicians seem to prefer using N<sub>2</sub>O because larger freeze zones from LN<sub>2</sub> exposes tissues to greater shear damage, and therefore possible perforation. </p><p>While Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) has been an attractive cryogen for treating skin lesions, it was felt to be unsuitable for bronchoscopic cryosurgery because it produces snow when it expands at atmospheric pressure. These solid particles can obstruct the instrument channel in the bronchoscope. Recent technological advances, however, are moving toward carbon dioxide systems with a cooling power similar to or equal to that of cooling temperatures provided using nitrous gas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4055707\"><span class=\"h1\">CRYOABLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryoablation (also known as cryotherapy) uses exceptionally low temperatures to destroy tissue with repeated cycles of rapid freezing and slow thawing of target tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F112826\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112826 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic principles and mechanisms of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Freezing tissue to -20&ordm;C or below, at a rapid rate (-100&ordm;C per minute) results in the development of intracellular ice crystals which induce more than 90 percent cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-cryotechniques-in-adults/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. Tissue is thawed slowly to allow intracellular crystals to increase in size before they melt, resulting in further tissue destruction. </p><p>Intracellular ice crystals cause cell death by the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damaging mitochondria or other micro-organelles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellular dehydration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased concentration of intracellular electrolytes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Denaturation of membrane lipoproteins resulting in cellular swelling and increased permeability </p><p/><p>Cryoablation also induces ischemic necrosis, independent of the direct cellular damaging effect. Vascular changes include initial vasoconstriction of arterioles and venules, altered vascular endothelium, increased permeability of vascular walls, increased blood viscosity, lower intracapillary hydrostatic pressure, decreased blood flow, and formation of platelet plugs. Ischemic necrosis from thrombosis of the target tissue microcirculation is thought to be responsible for the minimal bleeding associated with this modality. The end result is a clear line of demarcation between previously frozen tissue and unfrozen tissue. </p><p>Certain tissues are highly sensitive to freezing-induced destruction (ie, cryosensitive), while others are less sensitive (ie, cryoresistant). Examples of cryosensitive tissues include the skin, mucous membrane, granulation tissue, and tumor cells. Examples of cryoresistant tissues include fat, cartilage, fibrous, and connective tissue.</p><p>The depth of tissue penetration is approximately 3 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-cryotechniques-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This feature together with the resistance of cartilage to cryotherapy lowers the risk of airway perforation when compared with other bronchoscopic ablative techniques such as laser or electrocautery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoscopic-laser-in-the-management-of-airway-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoscopic laser in the management of airway disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endobronchial-electrocautery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endobronchial electrocautery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, the destructive effects of cryoablation are not immediate, but rather delayed such that it takes a number of days to weeks for the full effect of tissue necrosis to occur with continued tissue sloughing that often necessitates bronchoscopic removal of necrosed tissue during follow-up. Although attempts were made to overcome this delayed effect by using a larger probe to debulk tumor during the procedure, this form of cryotherapy (&quot;cryorecanalization&quot;) was complicated by significant hemorrhage (up to 10 percent requiring argon plasma coagulation) and remains investigational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-cryotechniques-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4056687\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.) </p><p>Large chunks of endobronchial tumors may be removed by a combination of cryoadhesion and cryoablation technique. This technique can especially be helpful for endobronchial tumor debulking in patients who cannot tolerate lower FiO<sub>2</sub> as all thermal debulking modalities (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet [Nd-YAG] laser, argon plasma coagulation [APC], electrocautery) require a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) &lt;40 percent to prevent airway fire.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4051796\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoscopic cryoablation is primarily a palliative or adjunctive therapy used for the relief of inoperable symptomatic central airway obstruction (CAO) most commonly due to malignant conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-cryotechniques-in-adults/abstract/1-3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,16</a>]. Less commonly, it is used to treat CAO due to benign conditions, and rarely, it is used to treat hemoptysis or inoperable microinvasive lung carcinoma. Since its efficacy is dependent upon direct contact, ideal lesions are intraluminal; it is not suitable for lesions causing external compression. Since the effect of bronchoscopic cryoablation is delayed (ie, days to weeks), it should <strong>not</strong> be used in those with life-threatening obstruction who need immediate relief. Although most cases of airway obstruction are located centrally (ie, trachea and mainstem bronchi), lesions down to the second or third order of bronchi can be successfully treated with cryoablation provided they are accessible to the cryoprobe and to subsequent cleanup bronchoscopy. </p><p>The approach to and choice of modality used to treat patients with CAO as well as a comparison between the locally ablative bronchoscopic techniques are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72854 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64246 \">table 2</a>).

In general, rigid bronchoscopy is used in patients with unstable airways or with underlying cardiopulmonary disease who may not tolerate conscious sedation for flexible bronchoscopy.

Precise distances cannot be recommended as the angulation and appearances may change depending on the location of the lesion, the position of the bronchoscope, and the type of probe used. If during freezing, the forming ice ball is growing, the scope may need to be slightly retracted to move away from it. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For lesions that directly project into the lumen, the metallic tip of the cryoprobe is either placed onto or pushed into the target tissue. This produces circumferential freezing of maximal volume. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For infiltrating, flat lesions, the cryoprobe is placed so that it has lateral tangential contact with the target tissue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three freeze-thaw cycles are then carried out. Some cryoprobes are equipped with a device that measures impedance. When such cryoprobes are used, reheating is begun when a plateau between 250 and 500 kilo-ohms is reached. Subsequent freezing cycles are commenced when the impedance has fallen to 50 kilo-ohms, but before the probe becomes unstuck. If a cryoprobe is used that does not measure impedance, the freezing and reheating times must be estimated. This is done visually, by watching the halo of ice form around the cryoprobe. When the halo stops growing, freezing should be terminated and the tissue allowed to warm up. Generally speaking, a freezing time of approximately one minute is required for the first freeze-thaw cycle when liquid nitrogen is the cooling agent. The freezing time is shorter during subsequent cycles. In contrast, a freezing time of roughly 30 seconds per freeze-thaw cycle is required when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> is the cooling agent. There is no value in prolonging the freezing beyond this time; instead, greater tissue destruction can be achieved by performing more freeze-thaw cycles. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The probe is then moved 5 to 6 mm and another three freeze-thaw cycles are performed. Each freeze zone should overlap the previous freeze zone. The procedure is continued until the entire endobronchial lesion has been treated. The frozen areas are larger with liquid nitrogen than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a>; thus, fewer freeze-thaw cycles are necessary and the procedure tends to be shorter when liquid nitrogen is used. (See <a href=\"#H4056416\" class=\"local\">'Cooling agents (cryogen)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The cryoprobe should be removed from the flexible bronchoscope only after it has completely thawed. Any icicle adherent to the probe may damage the working channel of the bronchoscope. This is less likely to occur when using a cryoprobe placed through the barrel of a rigid bronchoscope. </p><p>It is noteworthy that any back-freezing effect (with a snow-like appearance on the outside of the probe or on the probe's tip) can be caused by contact of a cold probe with moist air (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F112825\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112825 \">picture 2</a>). Theoretically, this phenomenon does not correlate with the type of gas being utilized because any cold gas transported from the probe's tip back through the probe may cause a back-freezing effect. To our knowledge, there are no published reports of bronchoscopes damaged from back-freezing. Regardless, most specialists advise keeping the metal tip of the cryoprobe as well as a portion of the plastic hose of the probe fully in view beyond the tip of the flexible bronchoscope during cryo application. </p><p>As an alternative to direct contact cryoablation, a non-contact approach has been reported where liquid nitrogen is sprayed onto the lesion through a specially designed cryocatheter (&quot;spray cryotherapy&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-cryotechniques-in-adults/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. It has the advantage of treating large areas rapidly and uniformly. However, in one study of 80 patients treated with spray cryotherapy, although rates of airway patency and hemostasis were high (&gt;90 percent), 19 percent had complications including hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, ST segment changes, desaturation, airway perforation, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bronchoscopic-cryotechniques-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].
