This longer time interval, referred to as system delay, is the sum of the prehospital system and door-to-balloon delays. For patients first brought to a hospital without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) capability, the system delay has multiple components. (See <a href=\"#H152207030\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>The associations between healthcare delays and mortality were evaluated in a study of 6209 patients with STEMI from 2002 to 2006 who were included in large, public medical databases in Western Denmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately one-third of these patients were field-triaged to a PCI center and two-thirds were admitted to a local hospital and then transferred to a PCI center. In this cohort, the median follow-up time was 3.4 years and the cumulative one-year mortality was 9.3 percent. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the univariable analysis of the components of delay (system, prehospital system, door-to-balloon, treatment, and patient), system delay had the strongest association with mortality (hazard ratios [HR] 1.22, 1.19, 1.13, 1.054, and 1.042, respectively). All hazard ratios were significant. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For system delays of 0 to 60 minutes, 61 to 120 minutes, 121 to 180 minutes, and 181 to 360 minutes, the long-term cumulative mortality was 15.4, 23.3, 28.1, and 30.8 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the multivariable analysis, treatment delay and patient delay were not associated with mortality, but system delay was independently associated with mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.16 per one-hour delay). The main components of system delay, prehospital system delay, and door-to-balloon delay were similarly associated with mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18 and 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24, respectively).</p><p/><p>While this study demonstrates the negative impact of increasing system delay on mortality, it does not allow any firm conclusion regarding the time at which an alternative strategy using a fibrinolytic agent would be preferable. (See <a href=\"#H233521064\" class=\"local\">'Transfer from a non-PCI center'</a> below.) <br/><br/>We believe that the earlier a patient presents (and thus a higher baseline risk), the less door-to-balloon delay that is acceptable. Thus, fibrinolytic therapy is an important option for patients who present within the first three hours and who are at a low risk of bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233520601\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct transfer from the field</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As pointed out by the authors of the Western Denmark study discussed above, one implication of worse outcomes with longer door-to-balloon times is that mortality may be improved with direct transfer to a PCI hospital compared with evaluation and treatment at a closer hospital without PCI capability. The feasibility and impact of this strategy on door-to-balloon delay was evaluated in a nonrandomized comparison of 344 patients with chest pain of less than 12 hours duration and ST-segment elevation characteristic of acute MI in 2005 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In this study, 135 patients were referred directly from the field by paramedics trained in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation and 209 patients were referred directly from regional emergency departments. The median door-to-balloon time, defined as the time between arrival at the first hospital to first balloon inflation, was significantly shorter in patients referred from the field (69 versus 123 minutes) and the percent of patients with door-to-balloon times of less than 90 minutes was significantly higher (80 versus 12).</p><p>For patients with STEMI diagnosed with a prehospital ECG who are transported to a PCI-capable hospital, one way to shorten the time to reperfusion is to bypass the emergency department (ED) and take the patient directly to the catheterization laboratory. The efficacy of this approach was addressed in a study of 12,158 STEMI patients, 10.5 percent of whom bypassed the ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The time from first medical contact to device activation was shorter in these individuals compared to those who went to the ED (68 versus 88 minutes; p&lt;0.0001). There was a trend toward lower mortality (2.7 versus 4.1 percent; adjusted odds ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.45-1.03). </p><p>Based on this study, and our experience, we believe that STEMI patients diagnosed with a prehospital ECG should be transferred directly to the catheterization laboratory of a PCI-capable hospital (bypassing the ED) if the following two criteria are met: The patient is hemodynamically stable and the patient is received by personnel (including one physician) qualified to care for critically ill patients. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233521064\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfer from a non-PCI center</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The worse outcomes seen with longer door&ndash;to-balloon times are of particular concern for patients with acute MI who are initially evaluated at hospitals without on-site PCI capability. The time spent at the first hospital, the subsequent transfer time, and the time spent at the receiving hospital prior to arrival in the catheterization laboratory are sources of longer door-to-balloon times. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Time from hospital arrival (door-to-balloon time)'</a> above.) The frequency, magnitude, and clinical impact of delays occurring at each of these time intervals were examined in a prospective study of 2034 patients referred to a PCI center (Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States) for primary PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delays occurred most frequently in the ED at the referral hospital, with less delay seen at the PCI center or in transport (64, 16, and 13 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the referral hospital, the most frequent reasons for delay were awaiting transport and ED delays (26 and 14 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>Diagnostic dilemmas, including nondiagnostic initial ECGs, led to the greatest delay, but these had limited or no impact on mortality. The door-in to door-out (DIDO) time is defined as the duration of time from arrival to discharge at the first (STEMI referral) hospital. The DIDO time is probably modifiable, as opposed to the non-modifiable delay caused by an additional ambulance ride. As a result, the DIDO time has become a performance measure of the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The 2008 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association Clinical Performance Measures for Acute Myocardial infarction recommend a DIDO time of less than 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The relationship between DIDO time and outcomes was evaluated in a study of nearly 15,000 patients who initially presented to a STEMI referral hospital and were subsequently transferred to a PCI facility; the patients were enrolled in the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network (ACTION) Registry-Get With the Guidelines (GWTG) between 2007 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

These logistic issues make primary PCI (PPCI) less available, especially at smaller, low-volume hospitals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80948\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80948 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73459\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73459 \">table 4</a>).

In a registry study of 2804 such patients, 30-day, one-year, and five-year all-cause (and cardiac) mortality rates were 7.9 (7.3), 11.4 (8.4), and 23.3 (13.8) percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

In the first prospective evaluation of electrocardiographic markers in patients undergoing PPCI, the prognostic utility of six different methods for evaluating the extent of ST-segment elevation resolution after PCI was assessed in 4866 patients enrolled in the APEX-AMI trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. All six methods were successful in predicting outcomes of death or the composite of death, cardiogenic shock, or heart failure at 90 days. One of these, the measurement of the residual, absolute ST elevation in the single, most affected (worst) lead 30 minutes after PCI, performed as well as the more complex methods. Data from additional therapeutic trials are needed before this marker can be considered a reasonable surrogate for clinical outcomes.
