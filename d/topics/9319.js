However, the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology in 2001 proposed a classification that takes into consideration both anatomic features and electrophysiologic mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Atrial tachycardia is the overriding term that includes two major categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal atrial tachycardia due to an automatic, triggered, or microreentrant mechanism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macroreentrant atrial tachycardia, including typical atrial flutter and other well-characterized macroreentrant circuits in the right and left atrium</p><p/><p>Intraatrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) falls into the latter group. Furthermore, the joint American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/Heart</span> Rhythm Society 2015 guidelines further defined macroreentrant atrial tachycardias that do not involve the tricuspid valve isthmus as &quot;atypical or non-cavo-tricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These macroreentrant supraventricular tachycardias often involve the left atrium, particularly after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation or Maze surgery for AF. They may involve any atrium where a scar, surgical or catheter-induced, may have taken place. This topic will discuss the mechanisms, clinical manifestations, and treatment of IART. Discussions of other specific atrial arrhythmias are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-atrial-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal atrial tachycardia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinoatrial-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia-sanrt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia (SANRT)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION, PREVALENCE, AND MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraatrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) refers to any macroreentrant atrial tachycardia that does not utilize the cavotricuspid isthmus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52904\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52904 \">figure 1</a>) as a critical pathway for the reentry to perpetuate. IART generally occurs in one of three settings: post-surgical repair of congenital heart disease (incidence of 16 to 50 percent post Fontan procedure, 15 to 48 percent post Mustard or Senning procedures, 12 to 34 percent post Tetralogy of Fallot repair), post-surgical scar (incisional tachycardia), or post catheter based or surgical management of atrial fibrillation (AF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. With the increase in AF ablation, an increase in IART is arising due to the surgical maze and catheter based procedures in the left atrium. IART has also been reported in the absence of surgical or catheter intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Reentry refers to a circuit in which previously excited tissue is re-excited, producing an extra beat or a sustained rhythm. Sinoatrial (SA) nodal reentrant tachycardia and IART (also called reentrant atrial tachycardia) are the two major types of paroxysmal reentrant supraventricular tachycardias in which the reentrant circuit does not involve the atrioventricular (AV) node or accessory pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82249\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82249 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinoatrial-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia-sanrt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia (SANRT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reentry pathways are usually defined by the following characteristics: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two discrete but connected pathways</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slow conduction in one of the pathways and unidirectional block in the other pathway</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Block in the pathway with unidirectional block following a premature beat, with conduction through the slower pathway allowing the pathway with unidirectional block to recover conduction and conduct the impulse back to the first pathway, hence initiating reentry</p><p/><p>Block may be anatomical (accessory bypass tract, slow or fast AVN pathway), functional (ischemia, electrolyte imbalance or anti arrhythmic agents), or both.</p><p>IART has a different activation sequence of atrial depolarization, leading to a P wave morphology that differs from that of normal sinus rhythm. In comparison, SA nodal reentrant tachycardia has an activation sequence similar to that of normal sinus rhythm so that the P waves on the surface ECG appear to be normal. Only the abrupt onset and termination of this arrhythmia distinguish it clinically from sinus tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H1013571688\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiological features'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinoatrial-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia-sanrt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia (SANRT)&quot;</a>.) </p><p>IART was responsible for approximately 6 percent of atrial tachycardias in patients referred for electrophysiologic studies to an active electrophysiologic group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Organic heart disease is common in adults with this arrhythmia. In children, intraatrial tachycardia is often associated with surgery that involves the atrium, such as the repair of an atrial septal defect or correction of transposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but may occur with any repair that includes an atrial scar. IART may be quite detrimental because of the elevated heart rate and the frequent loss of normal AV synchrony. It has been suggested that there is an increased rate of right and atrial thrombosis with IART.</p><p>The other group of patients in whom IART is seen is individuals who have undergone catheter or surgical ablation for AF. The incidence varies between 2.9 percent following pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and 31 percent following circumferential ablation associated with creation of linear lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Within this group of patients, reentrant tachycardia either exists as a macro- or microreentrant tachycardia. Microreentrant tachycardias are usually seen at sites of pulmonary vein reconnection following PVI for AF. Gaps in linear lesions formed for ablation of persistent or long-standing persistent AF promote the emergence of reentrant atrial tachyarrhythmias. These arrhythmias are often less well tolerated than the AF that prompted the ablation in the first place. They are often seen around the mitral valve (peri-mitral), in the atrium roof, or, less commonly, the septum. The cavotricuspid isthmus is not uncommonly involved. Studies have shown no added advantage to the creation of these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Society guidelines dissuade creation of these lines, confining them only to cases where IARTs are encountered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Focal IARTs are eliminated by isolating the reconnected pulmonary vein. </p><p>IART most often begins with an atrial premature depolarization that tends to occur quite early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/6,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12-14</a>]. The initiating beat may arise in either atrium, and an intraatrial conduction delay is necessary for the induction and maintenance of the arrhythmia. Ventricular premature beats very rarely initiate intraatrial reentrant tachycardia, and, if they do, it is usually due to rapid retrograde conduction through an accessory bypass tract, which results in the early prematurity usually required to initiate reentry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13989262\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations and significance of intraatrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) are variable, depending upon the hemodynamic effects of the increase in heart rate and the heart rate achieved. Some patients are asymptomatic, while others have symptoms that range from palpitations and lightheadedness to, in rare cases, syncope. If a patient is examined during an episode of arrhythmia, they will have a regular heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute.</p><p>Most episodes of IART do not precipitate hemodynamic compromise or limiting symptoms. However, higher ventricular rates associated with IART in a patient with underlying advanced cardiac or pulmonary disease can sometimes exacerbate their disease, leading to signs and symptoms of angina, heart failure, or worsening systemic oxygenation.</p><p>In the face of persistently elevated ventricular rates (eg, for weeks to months), particularly if baseline ventricular dysfunction exists, heart failure (tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy) may ensue. The atrial rates tend to be slower than the atrial rates in isthmus dependent atrial flutter, allowing 1:1 conduction from the atria to the ventricles and, subsequently, more potentially detrimental hemodynamic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13989352\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of intraatrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) should be considered in the presence of a regular but rapid pulse and heartbeat on physical examination. The diagnosis cannot be confirmed, however, without an electrocardiogram or, in most cases, invasive electrophysiologic studies.</p><p>The suspicion for IART rests on the patient's history combined with the electrocardiogram. A patient with a cardiac surgical history, particularly for correction of a congenital heart defect, presenting with what looks like atrial flutter should be considered to suffer from IART. Like other reentrant tachycardias, the onset is sudden, and vagal maneuvers may help slow the ventricular rate but will not change the atrial rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During an arrhythmic episode, the electrocardiographic (ECG) findings in IART are similar to those of most other regular supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), with evidence of atrial activity (P waves) associated with ventricular activity (QRS complexes) in a 1:1 fashion. In the appropriate clinical setting (eg, prior cardiac surgery, prior ablation, etc), the surface ECG can be highly suggestive of IART. However, the surface ECG alone cannot reliably distinguish between IART and other types of SVT, most notably focal atrial tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H1013571688\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiological features'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13989360\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>As noted above, P wave morphology in IART is different from that in normal subjects due to a difference in the activation sequence of atrial depolarization. The sequence depends upon the reentrant circuit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52904\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52904 \">figure 1</a>) which, in turn, may involve an anatomical obstacle or result from functional changes in refractoriness. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition, prevalence, and mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p>Clinically, the P wave morphology in aVL and V1 are useful clues in identifying the site of origin of the arrhythmia. A positive P wave in V1 and a negative P wave in aVL suggest a left atrial origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73578\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73578 \">waveform 1</a>), while a negative P wave in V1 and a positive P wave in aVL suggests a right atrial origin. These changes reflect the vectorial sequence. The left atrium is posterior and to the left, so the sequence of the activation for an impulse arising in the left atrium usually is anterior towards V1 (leading to a positive P wave) and rightward away from aVL (leading to a negative P wave); the sequence is reversed with a right atrial origin. Both reentrant and automatic atrial tachycardias will show these morphologies.</p><p>However, the electrocardiogram can be misleading in non-isthmus dependent macro reentrant tachycardias, particularly after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation where the index of suspicion is always high that the atrial tachyarrhythmia is left sided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Counterclockwise isthmus dependent atrial flutter characteristically displays upright flutter waves in V1 and negative flutter waves in leads II, III, and aVF. If the isthmus dependent flutter is clockwise, leads II, III, and aVF will display upright flutter waves. V1 will remain upright as well. Any departure from this pattern, particularly in the appropriate setting (post surgical procedure, catheter, or surgical ablation) should lead one to suspect a non isthmus dependent IART. Left sided IART can display similar electrocardiographic findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic features of atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1013571688\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiological features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically, it is important to distinguish intraatrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) from other supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), particularly focal atrial tachycardia. Since the surface electrocardiogram alone is not reliable in distinguishing IART from other types of SVT, invasive electrophysiologic studies (EPS) are employed to help make this distinction. Since macroreentrant atrial arrhythmias, including IART, are reentrant, they can be entrained during EPS with manifest and concealed fusion, and upon cessation of atrial pacing, the post pacing interval should be within 30 milliseconds of the tachycardia cycle length. The use of newer mapping techniques such as electroanatomic mapping further helps to make this distinction where focal mechanisms display centrifugal activation patterns, reentry displays an &quot;early meets late&quot;, and the entire cycle length of the tachycardia can be mapped to the chamber containing the tachycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cardiac electrophysiology studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The behavior of reentrant and triggered activity atrial rhythms may be quite similar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53347 \">table 1</a>), and intracardiac recordings are usually necessary to make the diagnosis with certainty. The following criteria have been used to help identify the type of arrhythmia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial tachycardia has conventionally been called reentry when the arrhythmia is abrupt in onset and termination and can be started or stopped by spontaneous or programmed premature beats. However, triggered activity can show the same features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> has been thought to be quite specific for atrial tachycardias due to cyclic AMP-mediated triggered activity and to enhanced automaticity. In several small cohort studies, adenosine was ineffective in terminating IART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Although some studies have provided conflicting data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,22</a>], the criteria used to define macroreentry did not exclude triggered activity as the cause of the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p>In comparison to the atrial abnormalities, conduction through the AV node, the specialized infranodal conduction system (His bundle, fascicles and bundle branches, terminal Purkinje fibers), and the ventricles is not directly impaired in intraatrial reentrant tachycardia. Thus, the QRS pattern and duration should not be abnormal unless the rapid rate causes some type of functional conduction disturbance.</p><p>Dual-loop figure-8 intraatrial reentry has been described that electrocardiographically mimics atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. All such patients had undergone surgery for ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) closure.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Efforts to acutely terminate IART should begin with vagal maneuvers.

Catheter ablation of IART is generally the treatment of choice for chronic management of this arrhythmia, given its efficacy combined with the relatively poor efficacy of pharmacologic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4694418\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute termination</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4694500\"><span class=\"h3\">Autonomic maneuvers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The autonomic innervation of the atria is less than that of the specialized myocardial areas which comprise the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. Thus, vagal stimulation has a variable and often negligible effect on reentrant intraatrial rhythms. However, it has been estimated that this arrhythmia can be terminated by carotid sinus massage in approximately one-fourth of cases, particularly those arising in the right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>As such, for the acute termination of symptomatic IART, we suggest carotid sinus massage or another vagal maneuver as the initial therapy.

We typically give a 1 mg test dose and, if the dose is tolerated, an additional 4 mg is administered over 5 minutes.

This is particularly true in younger patients who might be subject to the long-term side effect of years or decades of antiarrhythmic therapy.</p><p>Catheter ablation of macroreentrant atrial arrhythmias, including IART, has become the preferred treatment modality, with rates of acute success in terminating IART exceeding 80 percent in several cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. However, ablation does require specialized expertise and background knowledge of the predisposing factors. Electroanatomic mapping (EAD) and irrigated tipped catheters have further improved the outcomes after these ablations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>].</p><p>Excitable gaps are critical for all reentrant arrhythmias. An excitable gap allows a reentrant arrhythmia to be entrained, and if entrainment is achieved with concealed conduction, the critical pathway is identified. This feature is used therapeutically when overdrive atrial pacing is employed to terminate these arrhythmias. This was employed in the management of IART complicating surgically corrected transposition of the great arteries. The problem was that if it fails or if overdrive pacing accelerates the heart rate, it may lead to hemodynamic compromise and, in turn, death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Since an excitable gap is usually present in IART, an atrial premature depolarization or atrial pacing can usually cause a beat to be inserted in the reentrant pathway, thereby terminating the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Radiofrequency catheter ablation is extremely effective in patients with recurrent arrhythmias and has largely replaced chronic pacemaker therapy or surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58120%7ECARD%2F50219%7ECARD%2F82052\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef58120 graphicRef50219 graphicRef82052 \">waveform 2A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/6,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25-27</a>].</p><p>Intraatrial reentrant tachycardia is common after surgery for congenital heart disease. Radiofrequency ablation is successful, but the recurrence rate is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>]. The reentrant circuit for intraatrial reentrant tachycardia often involves the tricuspid valve isthmus following the <span class=\"nowrap\">Mustard/Senning</span> procedure and in other types of repaired congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The circuits in patients after the Fontan procedures differ, with the lateral right atrial wall being the more common area for successful radiofrequency ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Ablation or pacing for typical atrial flutter may give rise to macroreentrant tachycardias arising in the right atrium, with such arrhythmias occurring more frequently as the use of ablation and devices becomes more common. The term &quot;lower loop reentry&quot; has been used to describe counterclockwise reentry around the inferior vena cava where the anterior portion of the reentrant circuit is the IVC-tricuspid valve isthmus and the posterior arm is the low posterior right atrial wall across the crista terminalis, making it a variant of typical atrial flutter in which the superior pivot point is lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

However, many patients with IART have structural heart disease, which limits the choice of available antiarrhythmic agents.

This suggestion is based on the efficacy of verapamil in the acute termination of IART in addition to it generally being well-tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraatrial-reentrant-tachycardia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

IART generally occurs in one of three settings: post-surgical repair of congenital heart disease, post-surgical scar (incisional tachycardia), or post catheter based or surgical management of atrial fibrillation, although it has also been reported in the absence of surgical or catheter intervention. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition, prevalence, and mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IART, which is responsible for approximately 6 percent of atrial tachycardias in patients referred for electrophysiologic studies, has a different activation sequence of atrial depolarization, leading to a P wave morphology that differs from that of normal sinus rhythm. IART most often begins with an atrial premature depolarization and is perpetuated via a reentry circuit. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition, prevalence, and mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations and significance of IART are variable, depending upon the hemodynamic effects of the increase in heart rate and the heart rate achieved. Some patients are asymptomatic, while others have symptoms that range from palpitations and lightheadedness to, in rare cases, syncope. (See <a href=\"#H13989262\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During an arrhythmic episode, the electrocardiographic (ECG) findings in IART are similar to those of most other regular supraventricular tachycardias (SVT), with evidence of atrial activity (P waves) associated with ventricular activity (QRS complexes) in a 1:1 fashion. In the appropriate clinical setting (eg, prior cardiac surgery, prior ablation, etc), the surface ECG can be highly suggestive of IART. However, the surface ECG alone cannot reliably distinguish between IART and other types of SVT, most notably focal atrial tachycardia. Because the surface electrocardiogram alone is not reliable in distinguishing IART from other types of SVT, invasive electrophysiological studies (EPS) are employed to help make this distinction. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1013571688\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiological features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for intraatrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) is similar to that for other narrow QRS complex tachycardias (assuming there is normal AV conduction without bundle branch block). (See <a href=\"#H13989360\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While intraatrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) can be transient and asymptomatic, persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptomatic IART requires treatment to relieve symptoms and to prevent long-term sequelae such as tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For the acute termination of symptomatic IART, we suggest carotid sinus massage or another vagal maneuver as the initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

If adenosine is unsuccessful and symptomatic IART persists, we then use intravenous verapamil.
