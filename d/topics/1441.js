In most cases of isolated proteinuria, the patient is asymptomatic, and the presence of proteinuria is discovered incidentally by use of a dipstick during routine urinalysis. The urine sediment is unremarkable (fewer than three erythrocytes per high-power field and no casts), protein excretion is less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (non-nephrotic), serologic markers of systemic disease are absent, and there is no hypertension, diabetes, and also no edema or hypoalbuminemia.</p><p>This benign presentation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria is different from that in patients with more prominent renal disease who have one or more of the following: nephrotic-range proteinuria (&ge;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> lipiduria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an active urine sediment containing red cells (which are often dysmorphic) and red cell casts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four basic types of proteinuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F85791\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85791 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomerular proteinuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubular proteinuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overflow proteinuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-renal proteinuria</p><p/><p>Glomerular proteinuria (ie, albuminuria) is identified on a urine dipstick.</p><p>Some patients have more than one type of proteinuria. As an example, glomerular diseases, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, can be associated with proximal tubular injury, leading to tubular proteinuria. In addition, patients with multiple myeloma and Bence Jones overflow proteinuria (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Overflow proteinuria'</a> below) can also develop glomerular proteinuria and increased albumin excretion due to AL (primary) amyloidosis or a monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease.</p><p>Measuring the urine concentrations of both albumin and total protein (with either two separate tests or with a urine protein electrophoresis) can help determine the type of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this study of 1011 patients, of whom 68 had a kidney biopsy, the ratio of the urine albumin to total protein concentration was generally less than 0.4 in patients with tubular or overflow proteinuria and greater than 0.4 in patients with predominantly glomerular proteinuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Glomerular proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glomerular proteinuria is due to increased filtration of macromolecules (such as albumin) across the glomerular capillary wall. This is a sensitive marker for the presence of glomerular disease. The proteinuria associated with diabetic nephropathy and other glomerular diseases, as well as more benign causes, such as orthostatic or exercise-induced proteinuria, fall into this category. Most patients with benign causes of isolated proteinuria excrete less than 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Tubular proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-molecular-weight proteins, such as beta2-microglobulin, immunoglobulin light chains, retinol-binding protein, and polypeptides derived from the breakdown of albumin, have molecular weights that are generally under 25,000 Daltons in comparison to the 69,000 Daltons molecular weight of albumin. These smaller proteins can be filtered across the glomerulus and are then almost completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Interference with proximal tubular reabsorption, due to a variety of tubulointerstitial diseases or even some primary glomerular diseases, can lead to increased excretion of these smaller proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Tubular proteinuria is often not diagnosed clinically, since the dipstick for protein is not highly sensitive for the detection of proteins other than albumin and because the quantity of non-albumin proteins excreted is relatively low. The increased excretion of immunoglobulin light chains (or Bence Jones proteins) in tubular proteinuria is mild, polyclonal (both kappa and lambda), and not injurious to the kidney. This is in contrast to the monoclonal and potentially nephrotoxic nature of the light chains in the overflow proteinuria seen in multiple myeloma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Overflow proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins can occur with marked overproduction of a particular protein, leading to increased glomerular filtration and excretion. This is almost always due to immunoglobulin light chains in multiple myeloma but may also be due to lysozyme (in acute myelomonocytic leukemia), myoglobin (in rhabdomyolysis), or free hemoglobin (in intravascular hemolysis) that is not bound to haptoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In these settings, the filtered load is increased to a level that exceeds the normal proximal reabsorptive capacity. Patients with myeloma kidney also may develop a component of tubular proteinuria since the excreted light chains may be toxic to the tubules, leading to diminished reabsorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H188516482\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-renal proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammation in the urinary tract, which can occur with urinary tract infection, can give rise to increases in urinary protein excretion, although the mechanism is unclear. The excreted proteins are often non-albumin (often IgA or IgG), and only small amounts are excreted. Leukocyturia is frequently present in such patients. Patients with nephrolithiasis or tumors of the urinary tract may also have proteinuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265924166\"><span class=\"h2\">Amounts of proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal individuals, low-molecular-weight proteins and small amounts of albumin are filtered by the glomerulus. The actual amount of albumin filtered each day in humans is controversial. The majority view is that no more than approximately 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of albumin are filtered normally, but some investigators claim that as much as 200 g of albumin are filtered each day (with nearly all of the filtered albumin &quot;reclaimed&quot; in the early proximal tubule) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most of the filtered albumin enters the proximal tubule where it is almost completely reabsorbed, either intact or after degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The net result is the normal daily protein excretion of less than 150 mg (usually 40 to 80 mg), of which approximately 4 to 7 mg is intact, immunoreactive albumin.</p><p>Previously, abnormal proteinuria was generally defined as the excretion of more than 150 mg of total protein per day. However, early renal disease may be reflected by lesser degrees of proteinuria, particularly increased amounts of albuminuria.</p><p>The normal rate of albumin excretion is less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min);</span> the rate is approximately 4 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> in healthy young adults and increases with age and with an increase in body weight. Persistent albumin excretion between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> is called moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;). In patients with diabetes, this is usually indicative of incipient diabetic nephropathy (unless there is a coexisting renal disease). In nondiabetics, the presence of moderately increased albuminuria is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Albumin excretion above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> is considered overt proteinuria or severely increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;), the level at which the standard dipstick becomes positive. At this level, much of the protein in the urine consists of albumin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Even within the normal range, higher amounts of albuminuria are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

These are the standard urine dipstick and the precipitation of urine proteins with sulfosalicylic acid (SSA). Neither method is quantitative, and, if abnormal proteinuria is suggested by either technique, proteinuria should be quantified using a timed urine collection. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Quantitative measurement'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H424081\"><span class=\"h2\">Semiquantitative measurement</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Standard urine dipstick</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard urine dipstick primarily detects albumin but is relatively insensitive to non-albumin proteins.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Sulfosalicylic acid test'</a> below.)</p><p>The dipstick is very specific but not sensitive to low levels of albumin excretion. The lower limit of detection is a urine albumin concentration of approximately 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Thus, patients with moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;) will not usually be identified by this method unless the urine is highly concentrated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Issues with measuring urine albumin'</a> below.)</p><p>Dipstick grading (negative to 4+, based upon increasing intensity of color changes) is only semiquantitative and is highly dependent upon urine concentration.

Use of SSA is primarily indicated in patients who present with acute kidney injury, a benign urinalysis, and a negative or trace dipstick, a setting in which myeloma kidney should be excluded.

From the ages of 50 to 90 years, there is a progressive 50 percent decline in creatinine excretion (to approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in men, lower in women) due primarily to a fall in muscle mass. Formulas that incorporate race and weight with or without serum phosphorous in addition to age and sex may improve the estimation of creatinine excretion. This is discussed elsewhere in more detail.

These shortcuts generally involve measuring the ratio of protein to creatinine (or occasionally the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) in urine specimens of less than 24 hours' duration. Most commonly, the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) in a spot first- or second-morning urine sample after avoiding exercise is used to estimate 24-hour proteinuria and to follow the effects of treatment in patients with proteinuric kidney diseases. Usually, the urine protein concentration in a spot sample is measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and is divided by the urine creatinine concentration, also measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> yielding a number that estimates the 24-hour protein excretion in grams per day (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-spot-urine-protein-to-creatinine-ratio-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults/abstract/17-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-25</a>]. If SI units are used, the value for the UPCR (or UACR) in units of mg of protein per g of creatinine is divided by 8.8.

All patients had biopsy-proven glomerular disease (30, 20, 20, and 30 percent with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, or other glomerular disease, respectively). Among adults, the spot UPCR accurately identified patients with elevated 24-hour urine protein excretion above clinically significant thresholds (0.5 g, 1.0 g, 2.0 g, 3.0 g, 6.0 g, and 10.0 g).

Lipiduria is seen in patients with nephrotic syndrome, which implies glomerular disease.

In most cases of isolated proteinuria, the patient is asymptomatic, and the presence of proteinuria is discovered incidentally by use of a dipstick during routine urinalysis. The urine sediment is unremarkable (fewer than three erythrocytes per high-power field and no casts), protein excretion is less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (non-nephrotic), serologic markers of systemic disease are absent, and there is no edema, hypertension, diabetes, or hypoalbuminemia. (See <a href=\"#H424671\" class=\"local\">'Isolated proteinuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are four basic types of proteinuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F85791\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85791 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of proteinuria'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Glomerular proteinuria (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Glomerular proteinuria'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tubular proteinuria (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Tubular proteinuria'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Overflow proteinuria (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Overflow proteinuria'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Post-renal proteinuria (see <a href=\"#H188516482\" class=\"local\">'Post-renal proteinuria'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal daily protein excretion (including all proteins) is less than 150 mg (usually 40 to 80 mg). The normal rate of albumin excretion is less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min);</span> the rate is approximately 4 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> in healthy young adults and increases with age and with an increase in body weight. Persistent albumin excretion between 30 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> is called moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;). Persistent albumin excretion above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min)</span> is considered overt proteinuria or severely increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;), the level at which the standard dipstick becomes positive. (See <a href=\"#H265924166\" class=\"local\">'Amounts of proteinuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two semiquantitative methods are available to screen patients for proteinuria. These are the standard urine dipstick and the precipitation of urine proteins with sulfosalicylic acid (SSA). Neither method is quantitative, and, if abnormal proteinuria is suggested by either technique, proteinuria should be quantified using a timed urine collection. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Standard urine dipstick'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Sulfosalicylic acid test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with persistent proteinuria should undergo a quantitative measurement of total protein excretion. The gold standard for measurement of protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection. The major limitations of measuring protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection include the following: it is cumbersome for patients, and it is often collected incorrectly (over- and under-collections are common). (See <a href=\"#H424370\" class=\"local\">'24-hour versus spot urine collection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most commonly, the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) in a spot first- or second-morning urine sample after avoiding exercise is used to estimate 24-hour proteinuria and to follow the effects of treatment in patients with proteinuric kidney diseases. Usually, the urine protein concentration in a spot sample is measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and is divided by the urine creatinine concentration, also measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> yielding a dimensionless number that estimates the 24-hour protein excretion in grams per day (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-spot-urine-protein-to-creatinine-ratio-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). If SI units are used, the value for the UPCR (or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) is divided by 8.8. (See <a href=\"#H424370\" class=\"local\">'24-hour versus spot urine collection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the UPCR correlates well with 24-hour urine protein excretion on the population level, its usefulness in predicting the true 24-hour protein excretion in any given individual is debatable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63722\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63722 \">figure 1</a>). There are two major limitations of using random spot urine samples to quantify proteinuria: the UPCR and UACR are heavily influenced by the urine creatinine concentration (the denominator of the ratio) and therefore by the total daily creatinine production, and urine protein excretion can vary throughout the day. Consequently, the estimated protein excretion rate (ePER) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-estimated-protein-excretion-rate-from-spot-urine-protein-and-creatinine-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>) and estimated albumin excretion rate (eAER) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-estimated-albumin-excretion-rate-from-spot-urine-albumin-and-creatinine-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>), which can be calculated using information from a spot urine, may be more accurate estimates of daily protein and albumin excretion. (See <a href=\"#H425226\" class=\"local\">'Influence of the urine creatinine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H425233\" class=\"local\">'Variability of protein excretion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13062543\" class=\"local\">'Estimated albumin excretion rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the following approach to measuring and subsequently monitoring protein excretion, which takes into account both the greater accuracy of a complete 24-hour urine collection and the greater ease of monitoring with a spot urine specimen (see <a href=\"#H425240\" class=\"local\">'Suggested approach to quantification'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A 24-hour urine collection should be obtained during the initial evaluation, measuring the excretion of both protein and creatinine. The completeness of the 24-hour urine collection can be estimated from creatinine excretion, as described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the initial 24-hour urine collection seems complete, then the rate of protein excretion is probably an accurate estimate. The ePER (or eAER) on this 24-hour specimen can be related to the total amount of proteinuria (or albuminuria) and also compared with a random spot ePER or eAER. Random specimens can subsequently be used to monitor the degree of proteinuria as long as muscle mass appears stable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If follow-up measurements of the ePER (or eAER) suggest that a clinically important change in protein excretion has occurred, a 24-hour urine collection should be obtained to verify the change in proteinuria before therapy is altered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After a patient has been identified as having proteinuria, a careful medical history and physical exam may reveal a cause, such as diabetes mellitus, malignancy, systemic autoimmune disease, or a prior history of kidney disease. The urine sediment should be examined for indicators of glomerular disease, such as hematuria with dysmorphic red blood cells, specifically acanthocytes; red blood cell casts; and white blood cells or white blood cell casts in the absence of infection. Lipiduria is seen in patients with nephrotic syndrome, which implies glomerular disease. The serum creatinine should be measured and the GFR estimated by use of the CKD-EPI formula.
