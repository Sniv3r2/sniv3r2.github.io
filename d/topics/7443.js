Several terms have been used to describe this condition, including self-induced pulmonary granulomatosis, pulmonary angiothrombotic granulomatosis, pulmonary mainline granulomatosis, and angiocentric (or angiothrombotic) systemic granulomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Tablets intended for oral use typically contain insoluble binding agents, such as talc (hydrated magnesium silicate), microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone, potato starch, and cornstarch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Medications abused in this manner (either alone or in combination) include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> (Ritalin), oral opiates (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentazocine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentazocine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a>), and antihistamines. </p><p>Pulmonary foreign body granulomatosis will be reviewed here. The recognition and management of drug abusers and pulmonary disease in injection drug users are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of substance use disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-disease-in-injection-drug-users\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary disease in injection drug users&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of lung disease caused by injection of pulverized tablets varies based on the agent injected and the route of exposure. The most information comes from studies of talc granulomatosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Talc</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Talc (hydrous magnesium silicate) is used in tablets (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentazocine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentazocine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>, amphetamine) as a filler and lubricant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pulmonary granulomatosis has also been associated with inhaled cosmetic talc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Experimental injection of crushed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentazocine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentazocine</a> tablets or an equivalent amount of talc in dogs revealed similar changes in pulmonary artery pressures and lymph flow with the two agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Talc embolization causes an initial arteritis, which is associated with the rapid influx of neutrophils around the intravascular foreign body. This influx may in part be mediated by endothelial cell production of a neutrophil chemoattractant factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Increased levels of immunoglobulins and products of lymphocyte activation (eg, tumor necrosis factor, interleukins) are also present. Areas of thrombosis in the pulmonary arteries have been described in autopsy series of patients who died following acute injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/2,3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,7</a>].</p><p>The initial arteritis is followed by the development of foreign body granulomas, as talc particles migrate through the vessel wall to the surrounding perivascular and pulmonary interstitial tissue and are phagocytized by macrophages and giant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Over time, development of discrete small nodules occurs, resulting in replacement of normal lung tissue by mononuclear cells and multinucleated giant cells. This granulomatous inflammation leads to nodules that may coalesce into progressive massive fibrosis, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, and arteritis, depending on the intensity of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These changes occur predominately in a perihilar and upper lobe distribution.</p><p>In addition, after repetitive intravenous exposure to talc, emphysema may develop, usually distributed in the lower lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. It is thought that the emphysematous changes are caused by occlusion of small blood vessels due to intra and perivascular deposition of talc particles, leading to ischemia with alveolar wall necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Macrophage and leukocyte production of elastin-degrading enzymes may also contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As this pattern is reported after chronic injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>, it is also possible that the drug itself contributed to the pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Areas of low attenuation are sometimes seen with inhalational exposure to talc, but are not basilar predominant.</p><p>Autopsy series of intravenous drug abusers have demonstrated talc material in a variety of other organs, including the spleen (76 percent), liver (55 percent), portal lymph nodes (39 percent), bone marrow (24 percent), heart, and kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These extrapulmonary deposits generally produce little functional damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Nasal inhalation of talc-containing methamphetamine or cocaine can also cause pulmonary foreign body granulomatosis; however, this appears to be unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. When the talc is nasally inhaled, the foreign body granulomas and crystalline particles are typically found in the bronchial walls, rather than in and around the arterial walls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Microcrystalline cellulose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microcrystalline cellulose when injected intravenously as part of a pulverized tablet causes a similar pathologic process to talc with perivascular foreign body granulomatosis and angiothrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/14,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17-20</a>].</p><p>The larger size of cellulose particles makes them less likely to embolize to other organs, compared with talc, although embolization does occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. At least one case of cerebral vascular embolization of microcrystalline cellulose with granuloma formation has been reported in association with a clinical syndrome similar to multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The mechanism for systemic embolization despite the large particle size was thought to be recruitment of arteriovenous shunts due to extensive distortion of the normal alveolar architecture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88643434\"><span class=\"h2\">Crospovidone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crospovidone (polyvinylpyrrolidone, also known as povidone) is used as a binder in pharmaceutical tablets. This product is different from the povidone-iodine complex used as an antiseptic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/1,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18,21</a>]. </p><p>Crospovidone injection results in pulmonary angiothrombosis, destruction of the pulmonary arterial wall, and an intravascular and perivascular foreign body giant cell reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cotton-wool fibers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After tablets are pulverized, they are frequently heated and then filtered through materials such as cotton-wool before injection. The injected material often contains residual cotton-wool fragments that are embolized when the material is injected intravenously. Embolized cotton-wool fragments cause a granulomatous reaction in a rat model and in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23213239\"><span class=\"h2\">Cornstarch and soluble sugars</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cornstarch and soluble sugars including lactose, which are often &quot;cut&quot; into injectable illicit narcotics, generally cause only a transient foreign body reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the amount of starch injected may be considerable and result in sudden death due to vascular occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Injected cornstarch and potato starch are rapidly removed from the lung and do not cause the type of chronic progressive changes seen with talc and cellulose. In rats injected with cornstarch, an early foreign body reaction in the lungs is followed by the disappearance of the starch particles within seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23213266\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle fragments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embolization of needle fragments can complicate intravenous injection of drugs. In general, needle fragments migrate centrally and lodge in the lung parenchyma or pericardial fat and do not lead to significant pulmonary pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85088696\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with pulmonary foreign body granulomatosis usually present with nonspecific complaints such as dyspnea, cough, or an increase in sputum production. However, some patients will be asymptomatic, despite abnormalities on chest radiography, pulmonary function testing, or exercise testing. Night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis are less commonly reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

The chronic pulmonary hypertension that develops in patients with repeated injection of pulverized tablets should be differentiated from other forms of pulmonary hypertension.

Typically, the nodules seen in these diseases are slightly larger, up to 1 cm in diameter, than those of foreign body granulomatosis. However, as coalescence of individual micronodules of foreign body granulomatosis occurs, the radiograph may resemble the even larger nodules of silicosis or coal workers' pneumoconiosis. The presence of hilar and mediastinal adenopathy would favor a diagnosis of sarcoidosis or berylliosis.

In some patients, the clinical history and radiographic findings are highly suggestive of foreign body granulomatosis and further diagnostic evaluation is unnecessary, as long as the clinical course is stable. When patients present with an acute onset of dyspnea, fever, weight loss, or hemoptysis, evaluation for possible infection, malignancy, or other causes of interstitial lung disease is indicated. Depending on the severity of gas transfer abnormalities and the clinical suspicion of pulmonary hypertension, an echocardiogram and right heart catheterization may be indicated.

(See <a href=\"#H88641496\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.) Biopsy of organs other than the lungs, such as the liver, is usually not helpful as the likelihood of finding foreign body granulomas is less and extrapulmonary lesions are unlikely to be clinically significant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratory tests are usually normal or nonspecific.

More advanced disease is associated with a restrictive or obstructive pattern on spirometry and decreased or normal lung volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/foreign-body-granulomatosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>One question is whether injection of pulverized tablets is more damaging to the lungs than intravenous heroin abuse.
