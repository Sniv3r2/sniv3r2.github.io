Prolapse of the anterior wall typically coexists with prolapse at other anatomic sites (vaginal apex, posterior vaginal wall) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The prevailing view is that a common pathogenesis underlies support defects at different sites of the vaginal wall, replacing a previous focus on isolated anatomic compartments. Procedures for surgical repair of anterior vaginal wall defects should include repair of apical prolapse, if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) affects millions of women; approximately 200,000 inpatient surgical procedures for prolapse are performed annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Eleven to 19 percent of women will undergo surgery for prolapse or urinary incontinence by age 80 to 85 years, and 30 percent of these women will require an additional prolapse or incontinence surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Reconstructive procedures for prolapse of the anterior vaginal wall are reviewed here.

The arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis runs from the ischial spine to the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis. Despite common misconceptions, there is no vaginal fascia, only three distinct vaginal layers consisting of mucosa, muscularis, and adventitia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The bladder has no true support structures of its own and simply overlies the upper one-third of the vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The approach to treatment based upon this assumption was surgical plication or tightening of the weak and redundant anterior vaginal wall (ie, anterior colporrhaphy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The current understanding of anterior vaginal wall prolapse is that the etiology is not an overall stretch defect, but is the result of a specific defect in the support structures of the vagina as a whole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. Lack of attention to the specific defect in vaginal support structures has been proposed as a major reason that anterior vaginal wall prolapse recurs in as many as 40 percent of patients after anterior colporrhaphy alone or because the apex has also not been addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. The concept of a site-specific defect has replaced prior theories on the pathogenesis of anterior vaginal wall defects and altered evaluation and management of anterior vaginal prolapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Site-specific defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four anatomic sites of anterior vaginal support abnormalities were originally described by Richardson in 1976. Clinical practice and research have focused on midline and paravaginal sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], although these &ldquo;sites&rdquo; are difficult to study in isolation. The ability to diagnose these defects has not been well studied or validated. Midline and paravaginal defects are defined as: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Midline</strong> &ndash; Midline defects (also referred to as central) arise from vertical defects in the endopelvic fascia (musculoconnective tissue) extending anteriorly to posteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68850 \">figure 3</a>). They often interrupt support of the urethrovesical junction, contributing to urethral hypermobility and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On examination, a central defect is visualized as an anterior vaginal wall defect, but the lateral vaginal fornices are intact bilaterally (ie, a large anterior wall bulge still firmly connected to the lateral pelvic sidewalls). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paravaginal </strong>&ndash; Paravaginal defects (also referred to as lateral) result from detachment of the lateral vaginal wall from the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68850 \">figure 3</a>). As a result, the lateral vaginal sulcus descends, often accompanied by a moderate anterior wall prolapse, loss of the urethrovesical angle, and significant SUI. This type of defect can occur unilaterally or bilaterally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of a paravaginal defect is assessed using a tongue depressor (or ring forceps). The tongue depressor (or ring forceps) is placed in the lateral anterior vaginal sulcus and then elevated. If the anterior wall defect resolves, then this suggests lateral separation of the vagina from the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis. Both vaginal sulci should be checked, as vaginal defects may occur unilaterally or bilaterally. In contrast, a persistent anterior wall defect despite supporting the lateral vaginal sulcus suggests a central or transverse defect. </p><p/><p>Other site-specific defects that have been described include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transverse &ndash; Transverse defects occur when the pubocervical fascia separates from its insertion into the ring of connective tissue around the cervix and uterosacral ligaments, creating a transverse support defect and loss of the anterior fornix of the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68850 \">figure 3</a>). On examination, these defects often result in a large anterior vaginal wall defect, which appears to originate high on the anterior vaginal wall or near the cervix (also referred to as a high cystocele), although the urethra may remain well supported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal &ndash; Distal defects are the least common forms of anterior vaginal wall defects. They are due to a break in the fibromuscular support of the anterior vaginal wall, just before the insertion into the pubic symphysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These defects tend to be smaller and include the distal anterior vaginal wall (ie, near the introitus) and usually are associated with urethral hypermobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Vaginal wall abnormalities may be further divided into anterior or posterior. An anterior defect represents descent of the urethra and bladder neck with straining while a posterior defect represents descent of the bladder base [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4650631\"><span class=\"h1\">CANDIDATES FOR ANTERIOR PROLAPSE REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with bothersome symptoms attributable to anterior vaginal wall prolapse that decline or fail conservative therapy are candidates for surgical repair.

The need for repair of other anatomic sites of prolapse is guided by the preoperative evaluation. Currently, most pelvic surgeons agree that apical support must be carefully evaluated preoperatively in all patients to determine whether an apical suspension is indicated. Studies have demonstrated significantly improved anterior and posterior prolapse repair outcomes when performed concurrently with an apical support repair, transvaginal or transabdominal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This is discussed in detail separately. </p><p>Patients should be carefully examined in the office prior to surgery in order to assess whether there are support defects of the vaginal apex (cervix or vaginal vault) or posterior vaginal wall, in addition to an anterior vaginal wall support defect. If significant apical prolapse is noted, an apical repair procedure should be performed at the time of surgery. When apical repair is performed via an abdominal route (sacrocolpopexy), most surgeons will perform this portion of the procedure first and then proceed with an anterior colporrhaphy. This follows the principle of moving from a clean field (abdominal) to a clean contaminated field (vaginal) to decrease the risk of surgical site infection.

A detailed discussion with the patient allows the surgeon to differentiate symptoms that affect the patient&rsquo;s quality of life from those that are mild and not bothersome. Whenever possible, it is important to identify symptoms that are attributable to a specific anatomic compartment, since this aids surgical decision-making. As an example, women with advanced anterior and apical prolapse may experience urinary retention, but this is not associated with posterior vaginal wall prolapse. Prolapse is often present in more than one anatomic compartment (anterior, posterior, vaginal apex), however, and many symptoms are not specific to a single site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic site and degree of prolapse &ndash; POP is often present at more than one anatomic compartment and a coordinated approach to repair may be required.

Relevant symptoms should be elicited and further evaluation performed as appropriate. In addition, preoperative sexual function concerns should be discussed with the patient. Sexual dysfunction may be associated with POP. In addition, some women may experience dyspareunia or other alterations in sexual function following POP repair.

The vaginal field is classified as clean-contaminated. There are few direct data that address transvaginal pelvic floor surgery.

Indirect evidence derives from studies of vaginal hysterectomy, which involves the same surgical field.

The scissors are then carefully placed beneath the most superficial layer possible in the anterior vaginal wall mucosa and advanced with gentle pressure for 2 to 3 centimeters. The scissors are spread slightly as they are withdrawn, thereby assisting in dissection of the vaginal mucosa from the underlying tissue. The path of the scissors is incised, extending the vertical incision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This process is repeated until the level of the Allis clamp proximal to the urethra is reached. Additional Allis clamps are placed on the mucosal edges to assist in retraction. Once completed, further dissection of the mucosa from the underlying tissues is performed bilaterally until the mucosa has been dissected off the entirety of the bladder. Care should be taken to limit the dissection to the extent needed to correct the defect. Excessive dissection may increase the risk of denervation injury to the bladder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plication of the vaginal muscularis and adventitia is then performed using figure-of-eight sutures; some people run the suture placed as laterally as possible in the field of dissection, but deep enough to include only vaginal adventitia and muscularis and not bladder mucosa. Delayed absorbable sutures (eg, 0-0 Vicryl, PDS) are most often used and are tied in the midline. Multiple layers of closure may be used for larger defects. Care should be taken to avoid excessive tissue plication around the urethra, to avoid obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once plication of the defect has been performed, redundant vaginal mucosa may be trimmed. Excessive reduction in vaginal diameter should be avoided, as it may result in significant dyspareunia. At procedure completion, the surgeon should be able to easily insert two fingers in the vagina. The vaginal incision is closed with a fine delayed absorbable suture (eg, 3-0 Monocryl). </p><p/><p>For women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI), it had been a common practice to perform a Kelly bladder neck plication at the time of anterior colporrhaphy.

The vaginal plexus and inferior vesical vessels can easily bleed if care is not taken while dissecting this delicate plane. If a hematoma develops and is stable in size, it can be left in place. Bleeding must be controlled for any hematoma that is expanding; severe bleeding may require hypogastric artery ligation on the ipsilateral side. Opening and draining a significant and expanding hematoma will rarely reveal the source of active bleeding. </p><p>Postoperatively, if the patient has a vaginal hematoma or vaginal bleeding beyond minimal staining, a vaginal pack may be placed. A bladder catheter should also be placed to prevent associated urinary retention. Vaginal packing should be removed within 24 hours. If brisk vaginal bleeding persists, the patient should be returned to the operating room to identify the source and control the bleeding. If there is only a small volume of ongoing bleeding, the patient may be observed with assessment of vital signs, pad counts, and serial hemoglobin levels. </p><p>A stable hematoma will eventually resolve and may be managed expectantly.

For suture-only procedures, cases of wound breakdown can be allowed to heal by secondary intention. Wound infection is diagnosed based upon a finding of surrounding erythema and tenderness. Induration or a purulent discharge may also be present. Fever will develop in some, but not most patients.

These complications include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesh exposure &ndash; This typically presents with vaginal pain or bleeding, but may be asymptomatic. Exposed mesh may become infected. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesh contraction &ndash; The typical presentation is vaginal pain; bleeding is not commonly associated with mesh contraction. On examination, there is generally severe pain on palpation at the site of the mesh and a visible stricture of vaginal mucosa over the tissue, but usually no visible mesh. </p><p/><p>Pain or infection may occur in the absence of mesh exposure or contraction. Women with complaints of vaginal bleeding or pain following transvaginal placement of reconstructive materials should be evaluated for mesh-related complications.</p><p>In general, mesh-related complications are managed surgically with mesh excision. In cases of mesh erosion, the exposed mesh should be excised. Some surgeons may attempt to avoid excision areas of small mesh erosions (&lt;0.5 cm) by returning to the operating room, mobilizing the mucosal edges surrounding the erosion and closing the vaginal mucosa over the site. In our experience, such attempts are often not successful and many patients ultimately require mesh excision. &#160;</p><p>Following mesh excision, if there are no symptoms or signs of infection, the defect may be closed. If infection is suspected, the site where mesh was removed should be left open to heal by secondary intention and broad-spectrum antibiotics given. In our practice, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> since they offer broad spectrum oral coverage including anaerobes. Particularly after mesh kit placement, removal of all mesh is technically difficult and may result in further complications. Although infected mesh tends to come out easily with gentle traction, aggressive dissection to remove mesh that is not involved and is deeper in the pelvis is discouraged. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365169\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal pain or dyspareunia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal incisional pain typically resolves four to six weeks after the procedure.

As an example, in a meta-analysis of native-tissue POP repair, 4 percent of women had new onset dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In some cases, postoperative vaginal narrowing may cause insertional dyspareunia; vaginal dilation or release of any restrictive bands can be performed to facilitate intercourse and pelvic examination. Ideally vaginal dilation and intercourse are the best therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19855121\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prospective studies regarding isolated traditional colporrhaphy have reported a range of success rates at one- to two-year follow-up of 37 to 83 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/47-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-52</a>]. The range of anterior colporrhaphy success or failure rates vary based on the outcomes measured. Postoperative outcome metrics include the POP-Q assessment of anatomic support, standardized quality of life and satisfaction questionnaires, reoperation rates, and assessment of functional status. As an example, a systematic review and metaanalysis of 10 trials comparing traditional anterior colporrhaphy with permanent mesh colporrhaphy reported that traditional anterior repair was associated with more postoperative prolapse on physical examination and patient awareness of prolapse than permanent mesh repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In contrast, the two procedures had similar reoperation rates (3 versus 1.3 percent), de novo dyspareunia rates, and quality of life data. Definition of treatment failure is an important distinction to make when examining the outcomes of any surgical trial, especially regarding pelvic reconstructive surgery. Although prolapse recurrence, thereby failure rates, may seem high when using strict guidelines, it must be noted that only a minority of patients with anatomic failure by strict criteria are symptomatic enough to desire a second surgical repair, as illustrated by overall low reoperation rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1936017\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of reconstructive materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experts agree that anterior vaginal prolapse repair should utilize surgical synthetic mesh or grafts only under limited circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reclassified surgical mesh for transvaginal pelvic organ prolapse repair as a class III (ie, high risk) device and required manufacturers to submit premarket approval applications to support the safety and effectiveness of synthetic mesh use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

In one study of over 1200 women undergoing prolapse repair procedures, synthetic mesh augmented repairs were performed in 27 percent of surgeries in 2008, decreased to 15 percent in 2008 after the initial FDA warning, and dropped to 2 percent in 2011 after a subsequent FDA warning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Native tissue and apical support procedures increased significantly during the same time period.</p><p>In cases of recurrent anterior wall defects, the utilization of graft augmentation may be considered based on potential improved objective outcomes, despite associated increased potential complication risks and costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/53,62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,62-65</a>]. In one meta-analysis of randomized trials, native tissue anterior repair resulted in significantly higher rates of recurrent anterior compartment prolapse than repair augmented with a polyglactin absorbable mesh (52 versus 33 percent; risk ratio [RR] 1.39, 95% CI 1.02-1.90) or porcine dermis mesh (21 versus 10 percent; RR 2.08, 95% CI 1.08-4.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

We remove the catheter on the first postoperative day and check a postvoid residual after the patient&rsquo;s first void. A postvoid residual greater than 100 mL is considered abnormal. Patients with elevated postvoid residuals should continue mechanical bladder drainage either via continuous transurethral Foley catheter or intermittent self-catheterization until postvoid residuals are consistently less than 100 mL.

Many physicians also suggest that patients avoid weight lifting greater than 5 lbs, straining with bowel movements, and activities associated with sudden or repetitive increases in intra-abdominal pressure (ie, jogging, heavy weight lifting) for at least six weeks after surgery.

Based on the extent of concomitant procedures and type of employment, patients may need to be on medical leave for six weeks, however, most surgeons agree that vaginal surgery may require allowing a faster return to work after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior vaginal wall prolapse describes support abnormalities of the anterior wall of the vagina. Prolapse of the anterior wall typically coexists with prolapse at other anatomic sites, especially the apex (vaginal apex, posterior vaginal wall). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of anterior vaginal wall prolapse is thought to be defects at specific sites of the support structures, rather than an overall stretch of the anterior wall. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of anterior wall defects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative evaluation of women with anterior vaginal defects included identification of the specific site(s) of anterior defects as well as prolapse at other anatomic sites. (See <a href=\"#H4650631\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for anterior prolapse repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing surgical repair on anterior vaginal wall prolapse, we recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for surgical site infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25711799\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior colporrhaphy is performed to correct midline defects and is typically performed transvaginally. Anterior colporrhaphy is only moderately effective for repair of anterior vaginal wall prolapse. Success rates of anterior colporrhaphy range from 37 to 83 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1936642\" class=\"local\">'Midline defect repair (anterior colporrhaphy)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing primary anterior colporrhaphy, we suggest native tissue repair rather than use of reconstructive materials (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Use of reconstructive materials by surgeons experienced with the specific procedure may be considered only after appropriate patient counseling in women with factors that increase the risk of prolapse recurrence (eg, recurrent prolapse, obesity, large anterior wall defects). Such use should be carefully individualized and surgeons should counsel patients about the lack of efficacy and safety data and about alternative treatments. (See <a href=\"#H1936017\" class=\"local\">'Use of reconstructive materials'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-surgical-repair-of-anterior-vaginal-wall-prolapse/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rooney K, Kenton K, Mueller ER, et al.
