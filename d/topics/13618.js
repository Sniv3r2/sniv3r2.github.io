However, increasingly there is an appreciation that promoting physical activity will benefit the health and well-being of children and adults with CHD. The challenge for clinicians who care for these patients is to ensure safe participation in regular physical activity by tailoring recommendations to the individual's clinical status.</p><p>This topic will review the risks and benefits of physical activity, and an approach for assessment and recommendations for regular physical activity in children and adults with CHD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97359754\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following definitions related to physical activity, fitness, exercise, and competitive sports are used in this topic:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical activity</strong> &ndash; Physical activity is defined as bodily movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscle that increases energy expenditure above the basal level. It includes recreational and competitive sports, and daily living or transportation activities. In adults, a moderate amount of physical activity is roughly equivalent to physical activity that uses approximately 150 calories (kcal) of energy per day or 1000 calories per week. Examples of moderate physical activity include leisure cycling, moderate effort swimming, playing golf (walking), general cleaning at home, or lawn mowing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73838\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73838 \">figure 1</a>). Vigorous activity includes running, rope jumping, and calisthenics. Of note, individuals can be physically active without demonstrating significant fitness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical fitness</strong> &ndash; Physical fitness is a set of physical attributes that enable one to perform daily physical activities. Health-related physical fitness encompasses cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and body composition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise</strong> &ndash; Exercise is a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and purposeful, with a main objective of improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness. Exercise and sports can be divided into dynamic and static components, which can be classified along a spectrum of increasing static and dynamic intensity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dynamic exercise is joint movement through relatively small forces within the muscle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Static exercise involves generating relatively large intramuscular force within the muscle with little joint movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A specific activity will have dynamic and static components at varying levels. Some sports, such as distance running, have a high dynamic but low static component. Weight lifting and martial arts have a high static but low dynamic component. Boxing, rowing, and kayaking have both high static and dynamic demands.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Competitive sport</strong> &ndash; Competitive sport is defined as an organized individual or team sport that requires regular competition with others. It typically requires systematic and intensive training, and also is usually supervised by a coach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10234459\" class=\"local\">'Patients who wish to engage in competitive sports'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97359912\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need to promote regular physical activity in patients with CHD, as outlined in a 2013 American Heart Association scientific statement, is based on the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular physical activity in healthy individuals improves cardiovascular and mental health, and decreases the risk of several chronic conditions including obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus.

As a result, individuals with CHD can reap the benefits of regular physical activity seen in the general healthy population. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition that previous advice of avoiding physical activity due to concerns about worsening cardiovascular status or sudden cardiac death (SCD) may not be correct.</p><p/><p>Routine physical activity and exercise in patients with CHD are associated with better cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness, better quality of life, improved motor skills, and higher self-esteem in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/3-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-11</a>]. Routine physical activity also may have important long-term benefits of reducing obesity and cardiovascular disease, which are more prevalent in children and adults with CHD compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Several studies have reported that physical or exercise training improved exercise capacity and cardiovascular function in children with complex CHD with no significant adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/15-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-22</a>]. Data have also shown that physical training in children and adolescents with CHD is associated with a rise in daily physical activity, and improved psychosocial well-being with an increase in self-esteem and a decrease in withdrawal and somatic complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/19,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1004063044\"><span class=\"h1\">LACK OF EVIDENCE LINKING SCD AND EXERCISE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clear that activity restriction reduces risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with CHD, as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many CHD conditions associated with SCD are undiagnosed prior to the event of either sudden cardiac arrest or death, including hereditary cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, and other congenital channelopathies, and coronary artery anomalies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-death-in-children#H192520700\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest and death in children&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=athletes-risk-of-sudden-cardiac-death#H10177261\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Athletes: Risk of sudden cardiac death&quot;, section on 'Competitive versus recreational athletics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCD occurs more commonly at rest than with exercise in patients with CHD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a large multinational, case-controlled study of CHD patients who died suddenly, 10 percent of deaths occurred during exercise, 69 percent occurred during rest, and 11 percent occurred during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A prospective population-based study of repaired CHD in Oregon found that only 15 percent of sudden cardiac deaths occurred during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a prospective longitudinal study of 329 patients with repaired CHD, sports participation had no association with death, arrhythmia, or premature ventricular contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A population-based study that followed &gt;11,000 children with CHD identified 19 children (0.2 percent) who experienced sudden unexpected deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. No children died during physical activity; two children survived cardiac arrest during sports.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a long-term study of 500 patients who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty for congenital aortic stenosis (median follow-up 12 years), sudden death was very rare and exercise restriction did not confer any protective benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97360719\"><span class=\"h1\">NEED FOR INDIVIDUALIZED COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The challenge for clinicians is to balance routine daily physical activity and restricting inactivity for patients with CHD, while minimizing any potential risks from exercise. As a result, health care providers need to tailor recommendations for each individual based on a physical activity assessment, and monitor the effect of routine physical activity on his or her clinical status. (See <a href=\"#H97360725\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> below.)</p><p>In the past, activity for patients with CHD was centered on restriction rather than promotion of daily physical activity. However, the vast majority of patients with CHD can participate in daily physical activity and recreational sports. For example, patients who underwent an arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries can achieve daily activity levels similar to those of patients free of cardiovascular disease, even though they have a decrease in exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Nevertheless, certain physical activities may be detrimental to the health of a patient with CHD; this may result in limiting the intensity of the activity, <strong>but </strong>does not preclude participation in physical activity most days of the week. (See <a href=\"#H97360765\" class=\"local\">'Conditions with potential risks of exercise'</a> below.)</p><p>Discussion with both the patient and family is important to understand and address concerns that may reduce daily physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Several studies have shown that patients with CHD have reduced levels of physical fitness and lower levels of physical activity compared with those without CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/2,14,18,32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,18,32,34</a>]. The reasons for diminished activity are multifactorial and may be changing over time, but restriction from activity likely plays an important role. Children with CHD may be needlessly limited from physical activity by worried parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These restrictions are counterproductive and lead to unnecessary anxiety, reduced activity, and poor exercise tolerance later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The clinician should ideally provide a management plan to the patient and family with realistic and measurable goals based on the individual's clinical status. (See <a href=\"#H97360749\" class=\"local\">'Routine physical activity assessment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H968171381\" class=\"local\">'Goal setting for routine physical activity'</a> below.)</p><p>It is also important to review with the family differences between competitive and noncompetitive exercise. Participating and training for competitive sports typically involves high intensity levels of activity, which are usually imposed by the coach or playing conditions. Competitive sports are felt to be of higher risk because the individual may lose the ability to self-regulate his or her effort if symptoms should arise. It is important for both participant and supervisors to understand and implement medically needed restrictions, and to understand how to regulate and monitor activity levels even when participating in &lsquo;noncompetitive' physical activity. (See <a href=\"#H10234459\" class=\"local\">'Patients who wish to engage in competitive sports'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97360725\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to promoting physical activity in patients with CHD is consistent with the American Heart Association (AHA) scientific statement on physical activity counseling practices for children and adults with CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment and goal setting &ndash; Determine individual goals for each patient based on physical activity assessment, using history and evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness; this may include formal exercise testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise prescription and counseling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clearly and specifically articulate the benefits of routine physical activity to the patient and family and the detrimental effects of prolonged sedentary periods. For patients in whom activity restriction is medically necessary, ensure that the patient and family understand the reasons for restriction. Examples of acceptable activities based on the patient's current clinical status should be provided and promoted. It is important for the patient and family to understand that participation in less intensive regular activity is beneficial and should be encouraged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Discuss recommendations with the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> and provide a written plan of physical activity and restrictions to the patient and family, which are documented in the medical record.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provide guidance on how to build activity time and level so that patients are able to reach a daily goal of moderate to vigorous activity most days of the week. For adults, the recommended duration of daily activity is 30 minutes, and in children, 60 minutes. Supervised exercise training programs may benefit patients with complex cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/6,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up care &ndash; Assess and monitor ongoing routine physical activity and readjust goals as necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97360749\"><span class=\"h1\">ROUTINE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ASSESSMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97360757\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knowledge of the patient's underlying CHD defect and cardiorespiratory status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of exertional symptoms that may limit the intensity of activity, such as angina, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and increasing cyanosis.

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific cardiac conditions including hereditary cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome and other congenital channelopathies, some arrhythmias, and congenital coronary artery anomalies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;, section on 'Heart failure and cardiomyopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-management-of-congenital-long-qt-syndrome#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and management of congenital long QT syndrome&quot;, section on 'General measures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of wide QRS complex tachycardia in children&quot;, section on 'Congenital heart disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular dysfunction &ndash; Although there is a lack of evidence, it is thought that patients with significant ventricular dysfunction are at risk for ventricular fibrillation if they participate in intense exercise and competitive sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, these patients can still participate in a wide range of daily physical activity and recreational sports. This was illustrated in one study that reported patients with single ventricle physiology who underwent Fontan procedure from 1994 to 2001 exceeded the recommended normal daily activity level of 60 minutes per day as measured by three-day accelerometer and questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other cardiac conditions &ndash; Although evidence is lacking, there is consensus that individuals with the following conditions should be encouraged to participate in noncompetitive activities that have low to moderate dynamic and static components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coronary artery compression or insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Significant pulmonary hypertension &ndash; Right ventricular (RV) pressure approaching or exceeding systemic pressure with RV dysfunction or symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe left or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dilation of the aorta &ndash; Severe dilation of the aorta is associated with increased risk of aortic dissection. Exertion results in a rise in blood pressure that increases the wall stress of the aorta, which may increase the risk of aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxia &ndash; Although exertion may increase cyanosis in selected patients with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and intracardiac shunting, hypoxia should not lead to elimination of daily physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Rather, physical activity should be targeted to a comfortable level for each patient. A walk test with oxygen saturation monitoring can be useful for assessment and for guiding recommendations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope &ndash; In patients with CHD and exertional syncope, further investigation is necessary to determine and manage the underlying cause (eg, arrhythmia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients at risk for syncope should be counseled to avoid activity that would endanger themselves or others should an event occur (eg, horseback riding, scuba diving, rock climbing, and gymnastics). Other activities, such as swimming, ice skating, and bike riding, can be done with supervision.

Therefore, activities with a high likelihood for direct blows to the device within the chest (eg, boxing, tackle football, ice hockey with body checking, and combative martial arts) should be avoided to prevent damage to the device and soft tissue injury to the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Appropriate shocks from ICDs appear to successfully terminate arrhythmias during exercise and this should not be a concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Data are limited, but there appears to be no or only a small increased risk of shocks during exercise in athletes with ICDs. This was illustrated in a study of 372 patients with ICDs (10 percent with CHD) who participated in organized sports. The risk of shocks during periods of <span class=\"nowrap\">competition/practice,</span> other physical activity, and rest were 10, 8, and 6 percent, respectively. In this cohort followed for 31 months, there was no tachyarrhythmic death or externally resuscitated tachyarrhythmia during or immediately following sports during the 31 months.

While direct measurement using accelerometry is more accurate, there are a number of questionnaires that can be used to assess activity and inactivity relatively quickly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. These include the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and The Habitual Activity Estimation Scale (HAES); however, these tools have not been validated in patients with CHD.</p><p>In addition, the activity history should elicit any concerns that the patient and family may have regarding physical activity.

Formal exercise testing may uncover risks associated with exercise while the patient is still in a monitored, controlled setting.</p><p>In addition, patients with CHD are often unaware of their aerobic limitations. Because they have had abnormal physiology from birth, they do not perceive a decline or deficiency. This lack of awareness is most likely due to CHD patients adapting to their cardiovascular disease by self-regulating their aerobic participation. This is in contrast to patients with acquired heart failure who are more perceptive of their limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. As a result, exercise testing is more reliable than self-reporting in determining the functional exercise capacity of individuals with CHD.</p><p>Exercise testing uses a continuous, ramped increase in workload until the patient develops symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue) that cause the patient to feel unable to exercise at a higher workload. The type of physiologic data depends on the type of equipment used for assessment. For example, treadmill exercise tests with continuous echocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oxygen monitoring, and periodic blood pressure provide important basic information of changes in ECG, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, which is more expensive and less readily available, measures ventilation and respiratory gas parameters that are used to calculate maximal oxygen uptake (consumption), ventilatory efficiency, and anaerobic threshold.

Routine physical activity reduces the risk of chronic conditions of obesity and cardiovascular disease, which are more prevalent in patients with CHD. (See <a href=\"#H97359912\" class=\"local\">'Benefits of physical activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with CHD can participate in daily physical activity and recreational sports. Goals need to be tailored to the individual's clinical status based on a physical activity assessment. The assessment may identify conditions that may require limiting the intensity of activity, but do <strong>not</strong> preclude routine daily physical activity. (See <a href=\"#H97360719\" class=\"local\">'Need for individualized counseling'</a> above and <a href=\"#H97360749\" class=\"local\">'Routine physical activity assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management approach consists of assessment and goal setting, exercise prescription and counseling, and follow-up of activity and readjustment of goals as necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals are developed based on the following physical activity assessment:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History of the underlying cardiac defect, exertional symptoms (eg, dyspnea and syncope) or conditions (eg, ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias) that may limit the intensity of activity, and current level of activity. (See <a href=\"#H97360757\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiorespiratory assessment consists of basic cardiac evaluation that includes echocardiographic function measurements (eg, ventricular function), electrocardiogram, and, in patients with cyanotic heart disease, pulse oximetry measurement of oxygen saturation. In some cases, exercise testing is used to assess risk and functional exercise capacity of the patient in a monitored controlled setting, and is helpful in counseling and reassuring patients and their families. (See <a href=\"#H10234411\" class=\"local\">'Cardiorespiratory assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that a prescribed routine physical activity regimen is provided to all patients with CHD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H968171381\" class=\"local\">'Goal setting for routine physical activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with successful repair and no residual sequelae, the physical activity goals are the same as those of the general population. This entails 60 minutes per day of physical activity for children between 6 and 17 years, and 150 minutes for adults per week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For some patients, goals are modified by changes in the type and intensity level of activity. These include patients with compromised cardiac function (eg, ventricular dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> outflow tract obstruction, elevated pulmonary artery pressure, or dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta), arrhythmias, hypoxia, exertional syncope, or implantable cardiac defibrillators or pacemakers, or who receive anticoagulation therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up care for patients with CHD includes evaluation of daily physical activity, and adjustments based on activity history and clinical status. In some patients with activity restrictions, cardiorespiratory assessment including exercise testing may be indicated. (See <a href=\"#H968171684\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up for routine physical activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, we utilize the 2015 American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> recommendations and individual patient assessment to help guide decision making regarding participation in competitive sports. These guidelines provide recommendations tailored to the specific CHD defect or condition. (See <a href=\"#H1004059676\" class=\"local\">'Specific CHD defects and conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-and-exercise-in-patients-with-congenital-heart-disease-chd/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Levine BD, Baggish AL, Kovacs RJ, et al.
