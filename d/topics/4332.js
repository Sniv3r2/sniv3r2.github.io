(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hoarseness-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hoarseness in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1865934370\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Hoarseness&quot; or &quot;dysphonia&quot; are terms used to describe a change in the quality of the voice. The voice quality can be raspy, breathy, strained, fatigued, rough, tremulous, or weak. There may be a change in pitch, restriction of range, voice breaks, decreased projection, or abnormal resonance. The prevalence of hoarseness in children ranges from 4 to 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Hoarseness can be caused by any process that affects the structure or function of the larynx. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hoarseness-in-children-evaluation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hoarseness in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Physiology'</a>.)</p><p>Etiologic categories of hoarseness include infection, inflammation, trauma, obstruction or infiltration, and congenital anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73274 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In children, hoarseness is most often due to a benign or self-limited cause (eg, viral upper respiratory infection or vocal abuse and misuse) and can be managed with education, watchful waiting, and voice therapy. In addition, the growth of the vocal folds and laryngeal apparatus, change in habits, and change in the hormonal milieu that occur during puberty often contribute to improved voice quality. Surgery is reserved for persistent lesions with noted anatomic alterations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MUCOSAL LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hoarseness in children is most often because of benign lesions of the vocal folds (eg, nodules, polyps, hemorrhage, hematoma).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vocal fold nodules are the most common cause of chronic hoarseness in school-aged children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The majority of these lesions occur in boys, particularly at the age of nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Vocal fold nodules usually are located on the anterior-free edge of the vocal fold at the point of greatest amplitude of vibration (the junction of the anterior one-third and the posterior two-thirds of the vocal fold) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110113\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110113 \">picture 1</a>). They develop from repeated trauma and abuse to the vocal folds (eg, screaming or shouting) that cause an inflammatory reaction with fibrotic healing. Vocal fold nodules are bilateral and can range in size from slightly raised hyperkeratotic lesions to larger broad-based lesions that prevent closure of the vocal folds. Stroboscopy can best examine and define the nature of laryngeal lesions. In the case of vocal fold nodules, the mucosal wave should remain intact. Nodules can be confused with mid-vocal fold fibrotic lesions and congenital lesions with contralateral reactive lesions.</p><p>The symptoms of vocal nodules vary depending upon the size. Small lesions may cause mild raspiness and roughness of the voice, whereas large lesions may cause breathiness because of incomplete closure of the vocal folds.</p><p>Treatment decisions are guided by the needs assessment of the child. Intervention is warranted if there are social problems such as teasing, withdrawal, or self-image issues because of the vocal quality, or if there are problems with others understanding the child's speech, particularly in school. Absent these issues, watchful waiting is acceptable, since many of these voice issues resolve with growth.</p><p>Voice therapy is the most widely accepted treatment for vocal fold nodules. Resolution or significant improvement typically is seen within three to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Failure to resolve or progression with therapy suggests possible misdiagnosis and warrants laryngeal stroboscopy. Microlaryngeal surgery may be indicated for nodules that cause persistent and severe vocal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Children who require surgery also should receive voice therapy to address the underlying vocal abuse or misuse, as vocal fold nodules can recur in as little as three days if vocal habits are not changed.</p><p>Vocal fold nodules can be accompanied by other lesions of the vocal folds including hemorrhage, vascular varices, and hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The pathogenesis of these lesions is similar to that of vocal fold nodules: vocal abuse leading to inflammatory reaction with fibrotic healing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110111\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110111 \">picture 2</a>). Congenital cystic changes and or ruptured cysts also often present with bilateral mid-vocal fold swelling. A lesion on one side causes trauma on the contralateral side, resulting in bilateral swellings, often offset from each other.</p><p>The treatment of these processes mirrors that of vocal fold nodules, with surgery reserved for recalcitrant cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vocal fold polyps occur rarely in children. Vocal fold polyps are fluid- and fibrin-filled lesions that occur at the free edge of the vocal fold in the superficial layer of the lamina propria and thus differ from nodules that affect the epithelial layer. These lesions tend to appear unilaterally and usually are located at the junction of the anterior one-third and posterior two-thirds of the vocal folds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110114\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110114 \">picture 3</a>). Trauma, chronic irritation, reflux, smoking, and muscle tension dysphonia may contribute to their formation. Vocal fold hemorrhages can organize into vocal fold polyps. The symptoms of vocal fold polyps include hoarseness, diplophonia (having two different voice tones at the same time), raspiness, and breathiness. Surgical treatment is often necessary depending on the severity of the voice complaint, although voice therapy is usually attempted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle tension dysphonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have a strained, easily tired voice may have some degree of muscle tension dysphonia. Muscle tension dysphonia occurs when the muscles of the larynx attempt to compensate for mucosal abnormality by contracting abnormally. This can lead to a vicious cycle of microtrauma to the vocal cords and resultant dysphonia, which in turn leads to the recruitment of additional counterproductive vocal mechanisms characterized by strain, excess muscle tension, and glottic compression. The end result is a narrowing of the arytenoids, false vocal folds, true vocal folds, or the entire larynx. Muscle tension dysphonia is treated with voice therapy and a change in the vocal habits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">VOCAL FOLD GRANULOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vocal fold granulomas are highly vascular lesions of nonspecific granulation tissue that usually appear in the posterior glottis associated with one, and occasionally both, arytenoids. Vocal fold granulomas occur most often secondary to intubation-associated trauma and prolonged intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but also occur in association with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) disease, laryngeal trauma, habitual throat clearing, and vocal misuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. LPR, which differs somewhat from gastro-esophageal reflux (GER), is thought to be an important factor in the development and prolongation of vocal fold granuloma. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Gastroesophageal reflux/laryngopharyngeal reflux'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with vocal fold granulomas usually present with hoarseness, diplophonia, breathiness, dysphagia, vocal fatigue, cough, or the feeling of a lump in the throat (globus sensation).</p><p>The treatment of vocal fold granulomas depends upon the cause. Voice therapy can help to reverse or prevent poor vocal behaviors. Management of LPR and GER is essential for patients in whom reflux is a contributing factor. Microlaryngeal surgery is reserved for lesions that obstruct the airway and persist despite optimal medical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">VOCAL FOLD PARALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vocal fold paralysis is one of the more common laryngeal abnormalities of the larynx and cause of stridor in neonates and infants. Iatrogenic causes are the most common etiology, since there has been an increase in surgical interventions that can result in damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). Bilateral vocal fold paralysis occurs with approximately the same frequency as unilateral vocal fold paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Children with vocal fold paralysis have a high rate of spontaneous return of function, particularly if the paralysis is unilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of vocal fold paralysis in children include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic, most commonly associated with cardiothoracic surgery, invasive mechanical ventilation, thyroidectomy, and tracheoesophageal fistula repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic, probably the result of viral infection and autoimmune disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic, including Arnold-Chiari malformation, posterior fossa tumor, meningomyelocele, cerebral agenesis, and hydrocephalus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chiari-malformations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chiari malformations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury or compression of the RLN, which may occur because of stretching of the neck during breech delivery or because of intrathoracic lesions (eg, aberrant great vessels, left heart failure, tumors). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-birth-injuries#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal birth injuries&quot;, section on 'Neurologic injuries'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-rings-and-slings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular rings and slings&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>In one retrospective review of 113 children with congenital vocal cord paralysis, 37 percent of the cases were idiopathic, 26 percent were associated with neurologic disorders, 13 percent were associated with difficult delivery, and 5 percent were associated with cardiac malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of vocal fold paralysis are related to the functions of the vocal folds: voice, airway protection, and cough. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hoarseness-in-children-evaluation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hoarseness in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Physiology'</a>.)</p><p>Newborn infants with unilateral vocal fold paralysis may have an absent or weak cry. Signs and symptoms of aspiration may be present (eg, coughing with swallowing and recurrent pneumonia). Children with unilateral vocal fold paralysis typically present with decreased volume and power of voice and hoarseness that has a breathy, raspy quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Infants with bilateral vocal fold paralysis may be asymptomatic for the first six months of life. This is because the vocal folds tend to assume a midline position in bilateral paralysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76725\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76725 \">picture 4</a>), which protects the airway and permits a normal cry. However, as the child's activity level (and oxygen requirement) increases, symptoms such as dyspnea and stridor become more apparent. Concomitant upper respiratory tract infection or edema of the vocal folds may cause abrupt airway compromise, resulting in respiratory distress and stridor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-stridor-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of stridor in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of vocal fold paralysis can be confirmed by flexible nasolaryngoscopy in the awake infant or child. Direct laryngoscopy in the operating room may be necessary if the child is difficult to examine, if the larynx is poorly visualized, or to rule out other abnormalities of the glottic and subglottic region. In patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis, the ability of the contralateral vocal fold to compensate and the degree of posterior glottic opening (or chink) should be evaluated. In all patients, the presence of additional anatomic pathology should be noted.</p><p>Children with vocal fold paralysis should undergo additional evaluation to determine the underlying etiology. A chest radiograph and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow should be performed to rule out abnormalities of the chest and esophagus. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck and computed tomography of the chest may be necessary to rule out associated neurologic and thoracic abnormalities along the course of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Electromyography, although difficult to perform in children and not universally available, may provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Additionally, if chronic cough, recurrent pneumonia, or choking episodes are suspected, modified barium swallow or flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing should be performed to rule out aspiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Unilateral paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for intervention in children with unilateral vocal fold paralysis is based upon the degree of hoarseness and the risk of aspiration. Voice and speech therapy is directed to teaching children to compensate with the nonaffected vocal fold. The majority will improve with voice therapy. Swallow therapy may help in cases of mild aspiration to improve compensation.</p><p>Children who have gross aspiration and severe phonatory difficulty may require surgical intervention to medialize the paralyzed vocal fold. Medialization permits approximation of the vocal folds to protect the airway and improve voice quality. The medialization procedure varies depending upon the expected duration of paralysis as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If short-term paralysis is expected (eg, secondary to nerve trauma during surgery), the vocal fold can be injected with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a>, Gelfoam, fat, or collagen to provide temporary medialization. These procedures are typically done in the operating room with general anesthesia. Teenagers can have these procedures done awake in a procedure room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medialization thyroplasty can be performed in children with long-term vocal fold paralysis. In this procedure a small window is created in the thyroid cartilage at the level of the vocal folds. Silastic, Gortex, or hydroxyapatite material is then inserted into the window to help medialize the vocal fold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RLN reinnervation is another accepted form of treatment for children with vocal fold paralysis due to RLN injury. If the paralysis has been longer than one year or the nerve confirmed transected, the ansa cervicalis on the ipsilateral side can be anastomosed to the RLN as it enters the larynx. This does not provide mobility, but does provide bulk and tone to the affected vocal fold. A temporary injection is typically done at the time of surgery to provide closure while the nerve regenerates.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Bilateral paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the majority of children with bilateral vocal fold paralysis, the vocal folds meet in the midline. Chronic respiratory insufficiency and stridor, rather than aspiration, are the major symptoms. The child's <span class=\"nowrap\">voice/cry</span> can be normal. Surgical procedures are necessary to lateralize, or open, the vocal folds. The goal of treatment is to provide an adequate airway while preventing aspiration. Tracheotomy is required in 50 to 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. Other surgical techniques that should only be considered in children with permanent vocal fold paralysis include laser arytenoidectomy, cordotomy, and vocal fold lateralization. These procedures are usually performed after tracheotomy in an attempt to achieve a functional voice and an adequate airway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">LARYNGITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute laryngitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute laryngitis is defined as an inflammation of the mucosa of the larynx and can be caused by acute infection or vocal strain. The most common causes of laryngitis in children are related to viral respiratory tract infections, ranging from the common cold to mumps and measles. In addition to dysphonia, a child with a viral illness may have a low-grade fever, malaise, myalgias, rhinorrhea, cough, and mild dysphagia. Mouth breathing secondary to nasal congestion also can cause drying of the vocal fold mucosa and resultant hoarseness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Secondary bacterial infections, which are rare, should be considered in children who have fever, purulent exudate, or progressive pain, and fungal etiologies must be excluded in immunocompromised children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Acute vocal strain (eg, because of screaming at a football game) can cause submucosal vocal cord hemorrhage and edema with resultant hoarseness.</p><p>Acute laryngitis is usually a self-limited process and is treated conservatively with hydration, humidification, voice rest, and reassurance. Antipyretics and decongestants may be prescribed if warranted. Antibiotics are rarely indicated and should not be prescribed unless bacterial infection has been confirmed. Glucocorticoids should only be given if there is concern for airway compromise. Whispering can increase the trauma and must be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-management-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in children: Management and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute laryngotracheitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute laryngotracheitis (croup) is a common cause of acute hoarseness or stridor in children &lt;6 years old. Because they have smaller airways, children are more susceptible to edema and inflammation of the subglottic airway than are adults. The child with laryngotracheitis typically has a hoarse voice and a characteristic &quot;barking&quot; cough. Parainfluenzae virus is the most common viral cause of laryngotracheitis; however, other viral infections can have similar clinical manifestations. The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of croup are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-approach-to-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Approach to management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic laryngitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic laryngitis is defined as hoarseness, dysphagia, dysphonia, and vocal fatigue lasting &gt;3 months. Children with chronic laryngitis may present with a chronic cough or chronic throat clearing. Characteristic findings in the larynx include thickened, tenacious mucus, edema of the mucosa of the false and true vocal folds, and thickening of the epithelial lining of the mucosa.</p><p>In contrast to acute laryngitis, chronic laryngitis usually has a noninfectious etiology. Chronic laryngitis can be caused by the following factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to environmental irritants (dry air, solvents, industrial pollution, and some household products)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental allergy (new products, dust, cockroach feces, and other allergens)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic sinusitis with postnasal drip</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications (eg, inhaled steroids, anticholinergics, and antihistamines)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic dehydration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngopharyngeal reflux</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic systemic disease (eg, untreated or undertreated hypothyroidism, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancy (eg, lymphoma, sarcoma)</p><p/><p>The treatment of chronic laryngitis depends upon the underlying etiology and may involve avoidance of environmental irritants and allergens, treatment of allergic rhinitis, treatment of sinusitis, humidification, increased hydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and correction of any underlying systemic or metabolic disorders.

These disorders can manifest with aphonia, whispering, high-pitched voicing with voice breaks, or a strained voice. Psychogenic dysphonia is usually a defense mechanism or an adaptive behavior to obtain primary and secondary gain. The disorder usually manifests after a traumatic event, a viral syndrome, or during the anniversary of a traumatic event (eg, the death of a parent or relative). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Epidemiology and clinical presentation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children who have psychogenic dysphonia typically have a normal cry, laugh, and cough. Psychogenic dysphonia is a diagnosis of exclusion. Patients must have a normal physical examination, including laryngoscopy. The treatment of psychogenic dysphonia centers on the diagnosis and treatment of the underlying psychologic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Paradoxical vocal fold motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM; also referred to as &quot;vocal cord dysfunction,&quot; &quot;psychogenic stridor,&quot; &quot;Munchausen stridor,&quot; &quot;factitious asthma,&quot; and &quot;pseudoasthma&quot;) typically presents with recurrent acute episodes of dyspnea and stridor. Patients may complain often with throat tightness, a choking sensation, dysphonia, and cough. The disorder may begin at any age, but most commonly presents during adolescence. Children with this disorder may have a history of prior psychiatric illness, including depression, personality disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder, or they may have a history of childhood sexual abuse. Children and adolescents with PVFM have a normal laugh and cry and resolution of the stridor during sleep, or in some cases, when the patient is unaware of being observed. Patients may present with significant respiratory distress and dramatic inspiratory stridor. Adventitious sounds are loudest above the throat and are less audible through the chest wall, where the sound is attenuated by transmission through the airways and the pulmonary parenchyma. Because PVFM can coexist with true asthma, a thorough evaluation for asthma is essential. Treatment of PVFM is directed at the underlying psychologic etiology and involves psychotherapy coupled with respiratory retraining therapy or laryngeal control therapy, a specialized type of voice therapy. PVFM is discussed in greater detail separately.

It is defined by the failure of the voice to change from the higher pitch of early childhood to the lower pitch of adulthood and may be caused by a maladaptation to the psychological changes of puberty. Muscular incoordination, hyperfunction of the cricothyroid muscle, and psychological uncertainty are contributing factors. Children with puberphonia often have associated breathiness and decreased power of projection. Puberphonia is usually treated with voice therapy and problem-directed psychotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOCRINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of hormonal conditions can cause voice changes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hypothyroidism may have a coarse, raspy, breathy, and low-pitched voice resulting from myxedema of the vocal folds that alters vocal fold vibration. Proper hormone replacement and voice therapy can lead to improvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral contraceptive medications, hormonal therapy with androgens, and increased endogenous androgen activity occasionally can cause a coarse, low-pitched, raspy, or breathy voice. Alteration of therapy, treatment of the underlying abnormality, and voice therapy can lead to improvement. Monthly voice variation with the onset of menses can occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During pregnancy, the increased water content of the soft tissues and laxity of ligamentous insertions can alter the physical properties of the vocal folds, resulting in breathiness, raspiness, and a lowered vocal pitch. In addition, high pressure in the glottis from pushing during childbirth can cause acute injury to the soft tissues of the vocal folds, resulting in vocal fold hemorrhage, tears, and inflammation. Pregnancy-related voice change is usually treated with humidification, hydration, and reassurance, after a thorough endoscopic evaluation. Voice therapy is reserved for the cases in which conservative measures fail.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma is another important cause of acute and chronic hoarseness in children. The repetitive trauma of vocal abuse can result in vocal nodules, polyps, and scarring as discussed above. In addition, the mucosa of the respiratory tract, including the larynx, can be injured through exposure of the respiratory tract to caustic or noxious substance, and the larynx can be injured by blunt or penetrating trauma. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mucosal lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-acute-upper-airway-obstruction-in-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children&quot;, section on 'Trauma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucosal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure injury to the respiratory mucosa through caustic ingestion, inhalation injury, and exposure to noxious chemicals and fumes can cause acute hoarseness, loss of voice, pain, and, in severe cases, stridor and respiratory distress. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-stridor-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of stridor in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immediate attention to the respiratory status in patients with respiratory exposure is of primary importance. Patients who have stridor, drooling, nasal flaring, retractions, or tachypnea, or are using accessory muscles to breathe, are at risk for life-threatening airway obstruction and must be managed accordingly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients without significant respiratory distress can undergo flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy in a more controlled setting to evaluate the extent of mucosal injury, which can range from erythema or edema to ulceration, burns, and even perforation.</p><p>The management of mucosal injury depends upon the severity and can range from humidification and voice rest to immediate intubation or tracheotomy. Caustic laryngeal injury can lead to scarring, web formation, and glottic and subglottic stenosis, all which can cause chronic dysphonia. Surgical repair is possible in some cases; however, results are poor secondary to decreased ability to heal and chronic scarring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Intubation injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During intubation, a child's airway is particularly susceptible to injury from endotracheal manipulation. The relatively small diameter of the larynx and loose approximation of the mucosa to the underlying soft tissue permit early-onset edema and airway compromise. These changes can cause pain, breathiness, raspiness, and a change in pitch after extubation. The vocal folds also can be injured during nasogastric intubation.</p><p>Vocal fold edema, ulceration, lacerations, and granuloma are common after long-term intubation. Because these lesions can be exacerbated by laryngopharyngeal reflux, measures to control reflux should be considered during the period of intubation. In addition, long-term intubation can lead to subglottic and glottic stenosis, which can cause respiratory distress, stridor, and hoarseness. Minimizing intubation time, using of smaller sized endotracheal tubes with low pressure, high volume cuffs, and avoiding cuff pressures &gt;20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O should be encouraged when possible.

Blunt neck trauma can injure any of the anatomic structures of the larynx that are necessary for voice production. Children who have sustained blunt neck injury should also be evaluated for associated injuries to the head, cervical spine, and chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Immediate evaluation of the cervical airway is of utmost importance. Children with respiratory distress, crepitus, subcutaneous emphysema, stridor, tracheal deviation, cervical spine tenderness, or asymmetric carotid pulses require immediate establishment of a patent airway, stabilization of the cervical spine, intravenous access, and surgical consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Complete evaluation may include flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagram, angiography, and operative endoscopy and exploration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">TUMORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign tumors of the larynx are a rare cause of hoarseness in children. These tumors include papillomas, hemangiomas, cystic hygromas, and neurofibromas. Benign laryngeal tumors are usually slow growing and cause symptoms through interference with vocal fold mobility, compression of surrounding structures, and occlusion of the airway. Symptoms include breathiness, raspiness, voice breaks, altered pitch, and respiratory compromise. The diagnosis of benign tumors relies upon flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, stroboscopy, and possible operative laryngoscopy. Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging with angiography <span class=\"nowrap\">(MRI/MRA)</span> of the neck with fine cuts through the larynx can help to delineate the extent of the tumor and the possible etiology. Management of benign tumors typically involves surgical excision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h3\">Papillomatosis (HPV)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is the most common benign laryngeal tumor in children. RRP is typically diagnosed between the ages of two and three years, and most children are diagnosed before five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. RRP is thought to be caused by acquisition of human papillomavirus (HPV) during passage through the birth canal of an infected mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. HPV6 and HPV11 are most commonly involved, although HPV16 has been rarely observed and may be associated with an increased risk of malignant transformation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Human papillomavirus'</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for RRP include being the firstborn child, vaginal delivery, and having a teenage mother who has genital condylomata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. In one large retrospective cohort study, infants born to mothers with a history of genital warts were 231 times more likely (95% CI 135-396) to develop respiratory papillomatosis than those born to mothers without such a history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, among infants born to women with such a history, the risk of RRP was less than 1 percent.</p><p>HPV infects squamous mucosa, both naturally occurring and because of metaplasia of respiratory epithelium. Metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium can occur as a result of chronic environmental exposure or repeated trauma. Symptoms of RRP include hoarseness, breathiness, occasional respiratory distress, intermittent respiratory obstruction, and aphonia. Physical examination typically reveals multiple verrucous, polypoid growths overlying the true vocal folds, false vocal folds, subglottic region, and trachea.</p><p>In a small number of young children who have aggressive lesions, tracheotomy may be required for airway control. However, tracheotomy may be associated with an increased risk of recurrence and development of lower airway papillomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In children who have a less aggressive course, the treatment of RRP usually involves microlaryngeal surgery to debulk the lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Most children with RRP require multiple surgical treatments before puberty (when RRP often, though not always, regresses), particularly if they were diagnosed before the age of three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In one review of 399 children with juvenile-onset RRP, the mean number of surgical procedures per child was 4.4 per year (range less than one to 19) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
