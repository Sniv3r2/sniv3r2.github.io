The causative allergens in these plant foods are homologous to pollen allergens. The symptoms result from contact urticaria of the mucosal surface that touches the food, and symptoms are usually limited to the mouth and throat. Symptoms appear quickly after eating raw forms of the food because the responsible allergens are rapidly inactivated by cooking and digestion, although this is not always true. Systemic reactions are observed in 2 to 10 percent of patients, and reactions to cooked plant foods (including roasted nuts) are possible.</p><p>This topic review presents the management and prognosis of patients with PFS. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of PFS are reviewed separately.

In this review, PFS is the preferred term for the spectrum of reactions caused by allergens in plant foods that are homologous to pollen allergens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach presented in this topic review is based upon the author's experience because there are limited guidelines for the management of PFS, and clinicians vary considerably in their practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/1,3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-6</a>]. A questionnaire mailed to 226 randomly selected allergy specialists across the United States illustrated the variability in approach to this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of the 122 allergists who responded, 53 percent recommended complete avoidance of causal foods to all patients, whereas 9 percent did not advocate any restrictions. Sixty-six percent of allergists prescribed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> for PFS on a case-by-case basis, 30 percent never prescribed it, and 3 percent always did. (See <a href=\"#H2434562109\" class=\"local\">'Indications for epinephrine'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87926440\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary avoidance of the offending plant food(s) in the form in which it causes symptoms is the most common approach to management. However, strict avoidance may not be uniformly necessary if symptoms are mild. Additionally, patients may continue to eat forms of the foods that do not cause symptoms. Cooked, processed, and sometimes frozen forms of the foods typically do not cause symptoms of PFS. The purpose of avoidance is the prevention of future reactions. However, there are no studies reporting the impact of avoidance on the natural history of the condition. (See <a href=\"#H26942651\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2434562109\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for epinephrine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Practices regarding prescribing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> vary among allergists, and our approach is presented here. We advise patients with one or more of the following characteristics to carry epinephrine autoinjectors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic symptoms in the past.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharyngeal anatomy that may predispose to severe obstruction even with a mild degree of swelling, such as large tonsillar tissue or large tongue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia or significant throat discomfort during the past reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reactions of any severity to <strong>cooked</strong> plant foods, since this suggests the patient is sensitized to a heat-stable protein and may be at higher risk for a systemic reaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Established allergy (regardless of the severity of past reactions) to peanut, tree nuts, or mustard, as these foods are associated with higher rates of systemic reactions. Similarly, certain foods are considered higher risk in specific regions of the world (peach in Mediterranean countries and apple in Spain). The phenomenon of certain foods causing more severe reactions in patients in specific geographic locales is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Peach'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Apple'</a>.)</p><p/><p>For patients with positive skin prick testing using a commercial extract (versus the fresh food) to the causative food, we discuss the uncertain risk of systemic reactions with the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/parent</span>. If the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/parent's</span> preference is to have access to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> following that discussion, then we generally supply it. The role of skin testing in the diagnosis of PFS is reviewed elsewhere.

Dehydrated forms of the food may be used in seasonings and can cause reactions (eg, patients allergic to raw celery may react to celery spice, which is dried and powdered celery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>The decision to avoid cooked versions of the culprit food is influenced by the severity of the patient's reaction, the patient's recent history of tolerating cooked versions, and the preferences of the patient and clinician. This decision is usually made on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Tolerance to cross-reactive foods should be carefully evaluated in any patient who has experienced systemic symptoms, so that the foods that must be avoided are clearly defined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60787 \">figure 1</a>). If a cross-reactive food is being ingested on a regular basis without adverse symptoms, it is not necessary to test or restrict that food. In contrast, if the cross-reactive food is not a usual part of the diet, a clinician-supervised oral food challenge may be needed to determine tolerance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2276149697\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with oral symptoms to high-risk foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that all patients with established allergies to certain high-risk foods, regardless of the severity of past symptoms, avoid the foods that cause symptoms and learn to use and carry an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector. High-risk foods include peanut, tree nuts, and mustard because these foods are associated with serious systemic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, peach and apple, which are usually not considered high-risk in most areas of the world, are associated with systemic reactions in the Mediterranean region and Spain, respectively, where patients are usually sensitized to lipid transfer proteins. Thus, clinicians in these areas of the world should be cautious about these foods as well. (See <a href=\"#H2434562109\" class=\"local\">'Indications for epinephrine'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Apple'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Peach'</a>.)</p><p>Advice regarding avoidance for patients who have had very mild oropharyngeal symptoms to one of these foods is less clear, especially if the individual wishes to continue eating cooked forms of the food that are not currently causing symptoms. We typically explain to the patient that the culprit food is more likely to cause dangerous reactions compared with other foods and suggest that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> convert to strict avoidance if the symptoms seem to be worsening over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2276149858\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with oral symptoms to low-risk foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on guidelines and our experience, we manage patients with isolated oral symptoms based on severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. In most cases of PFS with isolated uncomfortable oropharyngeal symptoms, we advise patients to avoid the raw foods that cause symptoms, but we do not restrict potentially cross-reactive foods. We advise patients who tolerate cooked or otherwise thermally processed (microwaved, pasteurized, or baked) fruits and vegetables to continue to eat these forms of the food. When making this recommendation, however, the clinician must be certain that patients are not experiencing other types of reactions to the plant foods in question (such as worsening of atopic dermatitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome#H2434563687\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;, section on 'Patients with concomitant atopic dermatitis'</a>.)</p><p>Many patients with PFS choose to avoid the causative foods, but some want to continue ingesting fruits that are causing mild oral symptoms. Such patients should be advised to avoid eating large amounts of the food, such as in a fruit shake or during apple picking, and to stop if their symptoms appear to be worsening over time. The symptoms may worsen temporarily during or following the pollen season, and food should be avoided during such periods. H1 antihistamines may help reduce symptoms. We explain to such patients that the impact of ongoing exposure on the natural history of the disease is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER MANAGEMENT ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not suggest routinely premedicating with H1 antihistamines in order to eat the <span class=\"nowrap\">fruit/vegetable</span> in question, although antihistamines may reduce the symptoms of PFS, and there is no clear evidence that this approach is unsafe. In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients with birch allergy and hazelnut PFS who received a two-week course of the H1-receptor antagonist, astemizole, had significantly reduced symptoms on oral challenge compared with placebo, although symptoms did not resolve completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Still, the long-term effects of continuing to eat a food sporadically that causes PFS have not been evaluated. For patients with more significant oropharyngeal symptoms or abdominal discomfort, we advise them to eat only cooked or processed forms of the food that do not cause symptoms, instead of premedication with antihistamines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2434561555\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several forms of immunotherapy have been studied for the treatment of PFS, but this approach is limited by inconsistent efficacy. Although the efficacy of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and allergic asthma is well established, the benefits for PFS are uncertain. We do not suggest administering pollen immunotherapy <strong>solely</strong> for the purpose of treating PFS, although we would consider it if the patient is very troubled by the symptoms and accepts that clinical improvement as a result of immunotherapy is uncertain. This is consistent with the recommendations of European guidelines and American practice parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Injection immunotherapy with pollen extracts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trials of SCIT with pollen extracts in patients with PFS have shown mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 49 birch-allergic patients with apple-induced PFS, subjects were treated with 12, 24, or 36 months of SCIT and compared with 26 control subjects who did not receive SCIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Skin prick testing and nonblinded oral challenges with apple were performed before and after SCIT. Of those treated with SCIT, 41 (84 percent) reported a significant or total disappearance of PFS symptoms, with similar response rates regardless of the length of SCIT therapy. Skin reactivity to fresh apple was reduced in 88 percent. In contrast, none in the control group experienced decreased symptoms to apple or reduced skin reactivity. This trial was neither randomized nor blinded. The same group reported that following discontinuation of SCIT, skin test reactivity to apple gradually increased, although about 50 percent of patients who benefited from SCIT still tolerated raw apple more than two years after discontinuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The researchers hypothesized that immunotherapy might work best for PFS in adults monosensitized to birch tree pollen rather than to multiple pollens and in those treated with birch pollen extracts containing relatively high doses of Bet v 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second positive study, 25 adults with birch pollen allergy and PFS to apple were randomly assigned to birch pollen SCIT or medical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) were performed at baseline and at 12 months. In the SCIT group, 9 of 13 patients improved significantly, while 4 did not. In the control group, no patients improved.</p><p/><p>However, other studies were negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a carefully controlled (ie, double-blind, double-dummy, and placebo-controlled) study, 74 birch-allergic patients (of whom 74 percent had PFS to apple) were randomized to either SCIT, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), or placebo immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Apple-induced symptoms were assessed by open-food challenges before and after two years of immunotherapy. Forty patients were included in the final evaluation. There was a significant decrease in rhinitis symptoms and use of medications in the immunotherapy groups. Apple challenges were positive in 10 (SCIT), 4 (SLIT), and 10 (placebo) patients before treatment and 9 (SCIT), 6 (SLIT), and 8 (placebo) patients after treatment. The severity of symptoms to apple decreased in all groups but only significantly in the placebo group. Thus, despite a significant effect on allergic rhinitis, immunotherapy was not accompanied by a meaningful decrease in the severity of allergy to apple compared with placebo. One weakness of this study was the high rate of dropouts, although this is not unusual in immunotherapy.</p><p/><p>In addition to negative studies, there are a small number of case reports of PFS developing during SCIT or SLIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5924472\"><span class=\"h3\">Other forms of immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other forms of immunotherapy have been evaluated for the treatment of PFS, although all require further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5924553\"><span class=\"h4\">Sublingual pollen immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with pollen allergens appears to be less effective than injection immunotherapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of SLIT for birch pollen allergy did not show efficacy for alleviating PFS symptoms.

Subjects had birch pollen-induced rhinitis and oral symptoms to apple and underwent oral food challenge with fresh apple to determine the highest tolerated dose at baseline (1 to 64 grams). They were then randomized to active treatment (daily consumption of fresh apple) or control (no treatment). The study was performed outside of birch pollen season. A specific amount of apple was chewed carefully for one to two minutes and swallowed daily, and the amount ingested was doubled every two to three weeks. No treatment was given to 13 control patients. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving tolerance to at least 128 grams of apple at eight months. Those who achieved tolerance continued to eat a whole apple at least three times per week. Exploratory endpoints were questionnaires about symptoms to cross-reactive foods and pollen allergy symptoms, a conjunctival provocation test with birch pollen and Bet v 1, and in vitro tests (total immunoglobulin E [IgE], specific IgE, immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4] to Mal d 1 and Bet v 1, and basophil activation test with both allergens).</p><p>Seventeen of 27 patients (63 percent) in the active group could tolerate a whole apple by the end of the study, compared with 0 of 13 patients in the control group. Two patients withdrew (one developed diarrhea and the other had worsening oral symptoms), but none experienced anaphylaxis. Differences in exploratory endpoints related to systemic immune reactivity did not reach statistical significance. Among those who achieved tolerance, two had interruptions in apple ingestion of two to four weeks duration, with recurrence of symptoms in both cases, indicating that the tolerance was dependent upon ongoing exposure. Thus, this approach appears to be effective in a subset of patients but requires ongoing exposure once tolerance is induced. Larger studies are needed to better define the risks involved and determine if this approach is practical for a subset of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H695738472\"><span class=\"h4\">Sublingual immunotherapy with recombinant food allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with recombinant food allergens is an experimental approach to treating PFS.

The girl tolerated a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) to peanut and subsequently ingested regular amounts (30 to 40 g) of peanut without any symptoms over the three years following the DBPCFC. On one occasion, she skipped lunch and instead ingested a large amount (ie, 300 g) of roasted peanuts and developed a severe systemic reaction with low blood pressure, difficulty breathing, swollen lips, and generalized urticaria. She was treated with two doses of intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, oral antihistamine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a>. Repeat evaluation showed undetectable serum peanut-specific IgE, Ara h 1, 2, 3, and 9-IgE but positive Ara h 8-IgE. The girl spontaneously resumed eating small amounts of peanuts (30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/serving)</span> without any further reactions. Thus, it is possible that the ingestion of large amounts of the food, especially on an empty stomach, overloaded her digestive capacity and led to a systemic reaction. It is prudent to caution patients to avoid such situations. The specific allergens in peanut are reviewed in more detail separately.

Since pollen cross-reactive proteins undergo degradation in stomach and the intestine, any factors that alter intestinal permeability or speed absorption, such as exercise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and alcohol, may result in systemic reactions, and it is prudent to caution patients to avoid these substances if eating cross-reactive foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H695737810\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no known strategies to prevent development of PFS.

The symptoms result from contact urticaria of the mucosal surface that touches the food and are caused by allergens in plant foods that are homologous to pollen allergens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60787 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OAS is used to describe reactions limited to the oropharynx, while PFS is a broader term that encompasses both oropharyngeal and systemic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2276149452\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic reactions appear to occur in 2 to 10 percent of patients with PFS. Patients should be informed of this and of the possibility of reacting to related foods upon first exposure. We also provide patients with a printed diagram of related foods that might be expected to cause symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60787\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60787 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1955434710\" class=\"local\">'The risk of systemic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors for any patient with PFS who has experienced systemic symptoms in the past. Patients with PFS and systemic symptoms should avoid the raw form of the responsible food. We suggest that such patients also avoid cooked forms of the responsible food (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2276149664\" class=\"local\">'Patients with past systemic symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients who have <strong>not</strong> experienced systemic reactions carry <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors if any of the following are true (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2434562109\" class=\"local\">'Indications for epinephrine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2276149697\" class=\"local\">'Patients with oral symptoms to high-risk foods'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Allergy to peanut, tree nuts, or mustard has been objectively established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The patient experienced an oropharyngeal reaction to a cooked plant food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The patient had a positive skin prick test to a commercial extract for the culprit food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The patient reacted to a food that is associated with higher rates of systemic reaction in the geographic area in question (eg, peach in Mediterranean countries or apple in Spain).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with isolated oropharyngeal symptoms to raw foods that are not high-risk for systemic reactions need only avoid the raw foods that cause symptoms. Many wish to avoid the foods empirically, although if the patient chooses to continue ingesting raw foods that are causing mild oral symptoms, we do not object, because this is not known to be detrimental. We suggest that they avoid consuming large amounts and stop if their symptoms appear to be worsening over time. There is no reason to restrict cooked or processed forms of the food that do not cause symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2276149858\" class=\"local\">'Patients with oral symptoms to low-risk foods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H1 antihistamines can reduce symptoms, although the risks of suppressing symptoms and continuing to ingest the food have not been studied. Patients with systemic symptoms or PFS to high-risk foods should not use antihistamines in this manner. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Antihistamines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) with pollen allergens is a well-established therapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and allergic asthma, but studies of its effects on PFS are mixed. We do not suggest administering pollen SCIT <strong>solely </strong>for the purpose of treating PFS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
