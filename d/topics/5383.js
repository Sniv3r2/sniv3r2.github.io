This dynamic risk assessment approach allows for more accurate risk assessments than either a static estimate of risk based on the TNM staging system or the ATA risk of recurrence classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>The ATA recommends the TNM staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110635 \">table 1</a>) for all patients with differentiated thyroid cancer and any of the postoperative clinicopathologic staging systems to achieve more accurate risk factor stratification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It should be recognized, however, that no staging system reliably predicts outcome in individual patients; as a result, clinicians should use individual clinicopathologic characteristics to determine the specific treatment for a given patient.</p><p>It is important to note that the initial stage assigned to a patient is based upon information available in the first few weeks to months after diagnosis. In practical terms, this initial stage assignment does not change over time. In contrast, the estimates of the risk of recurrence and death usually do change over time depending upon how well the patient responds to initial therapy (surgery with or without radioiodine [RAI] ablation). As an example, patients who have had an excellent response to initial therapies would be considered to be at much lower risk for recurrence and death from disease than may have been predicted based on initial staging. Conversely, patients with an incomplete response to therapy may be at a higher risk of clinically significant disease recurrence or death than would have been predicted based on initial staging factors. Thus, we restratify patients on each follow-up visit using a reclassification system that emphasizes the response to therapy for each individual patient. (See <a href=\"#H408550\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic risk stratification'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging systems for predicting disease-specific mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given their relative ease of use and widespread acceptance, we prefer the TNM or MACIS staging systems to estimate disease-specific mortality. (See <a href=\"#H3671358\" class=\"local\">'TNM system'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'MACIS system'</a> below.)</p><p>In differentiated thyroid cancer, there are several staging systems for estimating disease-specific mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67533 \">table 3</a>). Each of the staging systems tend to use a core set of data that usually includes age at diagnosis, size of the primary tumor, extent of local extrathyroidal extension, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of distant metastases. The estimated mortality rates reflect both the predictive accuracy of the staging system and the variations in therapy at different institutions. There are sufficient differences among the staging systems such that practitioners using different schema cannot be assured that they are classifying patients in a similar fashion.</p><p>Application of several different staging systems to 1225 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer treated with total thyroidectomy and radioiodine (131-I) therapy revealed that the TNM system was best for separating groups of patients with distinctly different survival curves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Even so, none of the static initial staging systems were able to explain more than a small proportion of the variance in mortality in the patient population, while the dynamic risk staging systems that incorporate response to therapy variables into an active ongoing risk stratification system account for a much higher proportion of variance. (See <a href=\"#H408550\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic risk stratification'</a> below.)</p><p>The more commonly used staging systems for predicting disease-specific mortality are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3671358\"><span class=\"h3\">TNM system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) have adopted the eighth (2017) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification system, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2018 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110635 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The TNM system is optimized to predict survival in patients with thyroid cancer, based primarily on pathologic findings accumulated preoperatively, intraoperatively, and during the first four months after thyroid surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The updated 2017 TNM staging system is notable for the following changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age at diagnosis cutoff was raised from 45 to 55 years of age</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional lymph node metastases and microscopic extrathyroidal extension were removed from the definition of T3 disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T3a is a new category for tumors &gt;4 cm confined to the thyroid gland</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T3b is a new category for tumors of any size demonstrating gross extrathyroidal extension into strap muscles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level VII lymph nodes, previously classified as lateral neck lymph nodes (N1b) were reclassified as central neck lymph nodes (N1a) to be more anatomically consistent and to facilitate uniform coding for tumor registrars, clinicians, and researchers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of distant metastases in older patients is classified as IVB, rather than IVC disease</p><p/><p>Compared with the seventh edition, the changes implemented in the eighth edition downstage many patients into lower stages, more accurately reflecting their lower risk of thyroid cancer mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The updated system classifies fewer patients as having stage III or IV disease but conveys a poorer prognosis for those who do. The expected 10-year, disease-specific survival for patients &lt;55 years old with stage I or II disease is 98 to 100 and 85 to 95 percent, respectively. For patients &ge;55 years of age, the expected 10-year, disease-specific survival for stages I, II, III, and IV disease is 98 to 100, 85 to 95, 60 to 70, and &lt;50 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In a study evaluating changing the age at diagnosis cutoff from 45 to 55 years of age, there was a downstaging of 12 percent of patients using the higher age criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The 10-year, disease-specific survival of the downstaged patients was 97.6 percent.

Clinicopathologic staging was based upon patient age at diagnosis, tumor histology, tumor size, intrathyroidal multifocality, extraglandular invasion, metastases, and tumor differentiation. Between 1987 and 1995, 1607 patients were registered; 43 percent were classified as having stage I disease, 24 percent stage II, 24 percent stage III, and 9 percent stage IV. Patients with follicular cancer were more likely to have stage III or IV disease than those with papillary cancer. Of 1562 patients for whom censored follow-up was available (median follow-up 40 months), 78 died from thyroid cancer or complications of treatment. Five-year, product-limit, disease-specific survival was 99.8 percent for stage I, 100 percent for stage II, 91.9 percent for stage III, and 48.9 percent for stage IV. The frequency of remaining disease free also significantly declined with increasing stage (94.3 percent for stage I, 93.1 percent for stage II, 77.8 percent for stage III, and 24.6 percent for stage IV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67832 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H408534\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging systems used to predict initial risk of recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our practice, we use one of the popular staging systems to provide initial estimates of disease-specific mortality (usually TNM or MACIS) and then an additional clinicopathologic staging system, such as the ATA system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52272 \">table 2</a>), to provide initial estimates of risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. During follow-up, these initial risk estimates are continually refined as new data are used to assess response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H408550\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic risk stratification'</a> below.)</p><p>All of the popular staging systems reliably predict disease-specific mortality; however, they usually are not designed to adequately predict recurrence for individual patients. As an example, in a study comparing recurrence-free survival in patients with successfully treated differentiated thyroid carcinoma (undetectable stimulated thyroglobulin [Tg] and negative whole-body iodine scan), there was no difference in recurrence-free survival in patients initially classified as high or low risk based upon TNM stage at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Because of this limitation in current staging systems, the ATA proposed a novel clinicopathologic staging system designed to risk stratify patients as having either a low (papillary thyroid cancer confined to the thyroid), intermediate (regional metastases, worrisome histologies, extrathyroidal extension, or vascular invasion), or high (gross extrathyroidal extension or distant metastases) risk of recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52272 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H408542\"><span class=\"h3\">ATA risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2009 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for the management of thyroid cancer proposed a system to estimate the risk of recurrence in differentiated thyroid cancer based upon selected clinicopathologic features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52272 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Several retrospective studies have demonstrated that the 2009 ATA clinicopathology staging system accurately predicted the risk of disease recurrence and can be used to guide initial follow-up recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective review of 588 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer followed at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York, the ATA risk of recurrence staging system effectively predicted the risk of either recurrence or persistent structural disease, which occurred in 3, 21, and 68 percent of patients in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the 2015 ATA guidelines, the ATA low-risk group was extended to include patients with small-volume lymph node metastases (&le;5 micrometastases smaller than 0.2 cm), intrathyroidal encapsulated follicular variants of papillary thyroid cancer, intrathyroidal follicular thyroid cancer with no more than minimal vascular invasion, and intrathyroidal papillary microcarcinomas even if V600E <em>BRAF</em> mutation is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52272 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, the ATA high-risk category was extended to include patients with large-volume cervical metastases (&ge;3 cm) and follicular thyroid cancer with extensive vascular invasion. While still formally endorsing the three-tiered risk stratification systems, the ATA recognizes that risk of recurrence follows a continuum across the three discrete risk categories (low, intermediate, and high).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H408550\"><span class=\"h2\">Dynamic risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While initial staging systems can be used to guide initial therapeutic and diagnostic follow-up strategy decisions, it is important to recognize that initial risk estimates may need to change as new data are accumulated during follow-up monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. We typically restratify patients on each follow-up visit using a reclassification system that emphasizes the response to therapy for each individual patient. As originally conceived, these clinical outcomes described the best response to initial therapy during the first two years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>] but are now being used to describe the clinical status at any point during follow-up. At each follow-up visit, patients are classified as having one of the following clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/3,4,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excellent response &ndash; No clinical, biochemical, or structural evidence of disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biochemical incomplete response &ndash; Abnormal Tg or rising Tg antibody values in the absence of localizable disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural incomplete response &ndash; Persistent or newly identified locoregional or distant metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indeterminate response &ndash; Nonspecific biochemical or structural findings that cannot be confidently classified as either benign or malignant.

In patients treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total thyroidectomy and RAI remnant ablation, we define an excellent response as a stimulated Tg value &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (or highly sensitive, nonstimulated Tg &lt;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> with negative cross-sectional imaging (most commonly a normal postoperative neck ultrasound).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total thyroidectomy without RAI ablation, we define an excellent response as a stimulated Tg value &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (or highly sensitive, nonstimulated Tg &lt;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> with negative cross-sectional imaging (most commonly a normal postoperative neck ultrasound).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than total thyroidectomy (eg, lobectomy or lobectomy with isthmusectomy), nonstimulated Tg values less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> are considered excellent (approximately 50 percent of the Tg expected from an intact normal thyroid).</p><p/><p>Serum Tg values above the range considered &quot;excellent&quot; without structural evidence of disease are classified as biochemical incomplete response. Reclassification at each follow-up visit allows the clinician to tailor ongoing management recommendations to the current clinical status (rather than the initial risk stratification estimates).

Restratification during the first two years of follow-up in a cohort of 588 patients reduced the likelihood of finding persistent structural disease or disease recurrence to 2 percent in the low-risk, 2 percent in the intermediate-risk, and 14 percent in the high-risk patients that achieved an excellent response to therapy (stimulated Tg less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and no evidence of structural disease on cross-sectional imaging).

Several studies have demonstrated a poorer prognosis for specific subtypes of papillary thyroid cancers, including tall cell variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and poorly differentiated tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies suggest that specific molecular profiles may be used to predict risk of extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastases, and even distant metastases. While these observations need further validation, it is likely that the specific molecular profile of the primary tumor may have significant prognostic value that could be incorporated into staging systems in the future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in thyroid nodules and nonmedullary thyroid cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3689536265\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

However, they usually are not designed to adequately predict recurrence for individual patients. In addition, the estimates of the risk of recurrence and death usually do change over time depending upon how well the patient responds to initial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Staging for differentiated thyroid cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, we use tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110635 \">table 1</a>) or Metastases, Age, Completeness of Resection, Invasion, Size (MACIS) staging systems to estimate disease-specific mortality and then an additional clinicopathologic staging system, such as the American Thyroid Association (ATA) three-tiered risk stratification system, to estimate the risk of recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52272 \">table 2</a>). The risk of recurrence, however, follows a continuum across the three discrete risk categories (low, intermediate, and high). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Staging systems for predicting disease-specific mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H408534\" class=\"local\">'Staging systems used to predict initial risk of recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial risk assessments are actively modified based on data obtained during follow-up that reflect the individualized patient's response to therapy. This dynamic risk assessment approach allows for more accurate risk assessments than either a static estimate of risk based on the TNM staging system or the ATA risk of recurrence classification system. (See <a href=\"#H408550\" class=\"local\">'Dynamic risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It should be recognized, however, that no staging system predicts outcome in individual patients with 100 percent accuracy; as a result, clinicians should use individual clinicopathologic characteristics to determine the specific treatment for a given patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the clinical and histopathologic factors included in most thyroid cancer staging systems (age at diagnosis, size of the primary tumor, extent of local extrathyroidal extension, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of distance metastases), several other factors have been described that also appear to have prognostic significance, including multifocality, histologic subtypes, and molecular characteristics.
