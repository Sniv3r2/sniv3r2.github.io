Other causes of SCA and SCD are asystole and pulseless electrical activity. These events most commonly occur in patients with structural heart disease (that may not have been previously diagnosed), particularly coronary heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation) results in the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and restored circulation. The event is called SCD if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of SCA consists of emergent resuscitation followed, in survivors, by immediate postresuscitative care and attempted long-term prevention of recurrence using pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Over time, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed by bystanders has increased, and the interval between collapse and defibrillation has decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Despite these improvements as well as advances in the treatment of heart disease, the outcome of patients experiencing SCA remains poor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and outcomes following sudden cardiac arrest in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, there are two first-line therapies of resuscitation that have been shown to be associated with improved survival: excellent chest compressions and early defibrillation. Resuscitation should focus on these two elements. This is not to say that advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) therapies should be withheld if considered and indicated; however, if a shockable rhythm has not been identified and defibrillated, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excellent CPR is not being performed, any other non-scientifically supported interventions should be delayed until these first-line therapies are implemented. In general, the performance of the second-line interventions (as part of ACLS) should almost never interfere with defibrillation and excellent CPR. </p><p>Another therapy that has shown a neurologically-favorable survival advantage is targeted temperature management (TTM). This is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Targeted temperature management'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults#H9724176\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-cardiac arrest management in adults&quot;, section on 'Targeted temperature management (TTM) and therapeutic hypothermia (TH)'</a>.)</p><p>The data supporting advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) recommendations for the management of SCA will be reviewed here. The performance of ACLS, controversies surrounding cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and issues related to the prevention of recurrent SCA in survivors are discussed separately.

Survival depends upon prompt, high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with chest compressions and the earliest defibrillation possible to reestablish organized electrical activity with a stable sinus or supraventricular rhythm. Excellent CPR is a priority and should be maintained throughout the resuscitative effort; pauses should only occur at two-minute intervals for rhythm analysis and defibrillation. Other procedures, such as advanced airway management or vascular access, should not be performed in the initial resuscitation efforts (ie, first few minutes) unless they can be performed without interrupting CPR and defibrillation, or should be attempted during the pauses for rhythm check and possible defibrillation. Attempts at these procedures should be brief and should never create prolonged delays in resumption of CPR. Assessment for return of spontaneous circulation should not occur during the two-minute periods of CPR, and when performed, should be kept as brief as possible. The institution of routine quantitative end-tidal CO2 monitoring during resuscitation should help in assessing the quality of CPR as well as identifying return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specific issues relating to the management of VF and pulseless VT, including technical aspects of defibrillation, are discussed below. The use of automated external defibrillators (AED) for the treatment of cardiac arrest is presented separately.

VF rarely, if ever, terminates spontaneously or after delivery of an antiarrhythmic drug.

In a prospective observational cohort of 506 adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, patients with the highest chest compression fractions (61 to 80 percent and 81 to 100 percent), defined as the proportion of time in cardiac arrest without spontaneous circulation during which chest compressions were being performed, had the greatest chance of survival to hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratios [OR] 3.01, 95% CI 1.37-6.58 and 2.33, 95% CI 0.96-5.63 respectively). Defibrillators should be fully charged prior to cessation of compressions, after which immediate rhythm identification and shock delivery is performed as indicated (this should typically occur in no more than three to five seconds).</p><p>In a series of over 12,000 patients treated by Emergency Medical Services, 4546 had witnessed VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For these patients with witnessed VF, a shorter defibrillation response interval was significantly correlated with an increased chance of survival to hospital discharge. The analysis yielded an odds ratio for survival of 0.88 for every one-minute increase in response time, which corresponds to a 3 to 5 percent drop in survival for each minute of delay to defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>There is debate about whether CPR should be performed prior to defibrillation. Outcomes may be improved by performing CPR before defibrillation, in particular if the patient has been in SCA for a longer time period. This was illustrated in a retrospective report that compared outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital VF in two time periods: when an initial shock was given as soon as possible; and when the initial shock was delayed until 90 seconds of CPR had been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Survival to hospital discharge was significantly increased with routine CPR before defibrillation (30 versus 24 percent without prior CPR); this benefit was primarily seen in patients in whom the initial response interval was four minutes or longer (27 versus 17 percent without prior CPR).</p><p>In a randomized controlled trial in which 200 patients presenting with out-of-hospital VF were assigned to immediate defibrillation or CPR for three minutes prior to the first defibrillation attempt, there was no difference in outcome between the two groups for patients with an EMS response time &le;5 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For those with response times &gt;5 minutes, patients undergoing CPR first were significantly more likely to survive to hospital discharge (22 versus 4 percent). Subsequent randomized controlled studies, however, have not confirmed that performing CPR prior to defibrillation improves survival to hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. As one example, in a randomized trial of 9933 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were assigned to either 30 to 60 seconds of CPR versus 180 seconds of CPR prior to initial cardiac rhythm analysis, there was no significant difference in survival to hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Practically, however, in nearly all cardiac arrest, rescuers should perform excellent compressions before the arrival and deployment of an AED or while a <span class=\"nowrap\">monitor/defibrillator</span> is being placed and charged. Thus, CPR should be performed prior to defibrillation in these situations. Defibrillation should occur immediately if a patient is monitored with defibrillator pads in place, as in ICU and post-ROSC situations. In this circumstance, the 5 to 10 compressions done prior to defibrillation will not develop the perfusion pressures necessary to have an effect.</p><p>Further discussion on the timing of defibrillation and its impact on outcomes in patients with sudden cardiac arrest is presented separately.</p><p>Based upon the above studies, the 2015 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care suggest the initiation of CPR while awaiting the arrival of a defibrillator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Once the defibrillator is attached to the patient, CPR should be briefly stopped to allow for a rhythm check and shock, if indicated (cessation of compressions should not occur until the defibrillator is fully charged), followed by immediate resumption of CPR for two minutes prior to any additional rhythm checks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Defibrillatory waveforms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defibrillators manufactured prior to 2000 deliver a monophasic wave of direct electrical current. Since then, &quot;biphasic&quot; devices have been developed, which reverse current polarity 5 to 10 milliseconds after discharge begins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51842\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51842 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Biphasic waveforms defibrillate more effectively and at lower energies than monophasic waveforms. They have a much higher likelihood of first shock efficacy, which is the basis for the current recommendation to deliver a single shock compared with earlier recommendations that three shocks be delivered in rapid succession [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Routine use of high-dose epinephrine is not supported by data and is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the only randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> versus placebo, in which 601 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomized in a double blind fashion to either epinephrine or placebo, patients who received epinephrine were more likely to have return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC; 24 versus 8 percent; OR 3.4; 95% CI 2.0-5.6) and survival to hospital admission, but there was no significant improvement in survival to hospital discharge (4 versus 1.9 percent; OR 2.2; 95% CI 0.7-6.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the benefits of epinephrine (and other vasopressors) in the treatment of cardiac arrest have been questioned in nonrandomized studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective observational study of 417,188 adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, investigators compared ROSC, survival, and neurologic outcome in patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (15,030 patients, 3.6 percent) with those who did not receive epinephrine (402,158 patients, 96.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While there was a significantly greater ROSC in the epinephrine group (18.5 versus 5.7 percent using raw data, 18.3 versus 10.5 percent using propensity analysis), this did not translate into improved outcomes. In fact, using propensity analysis, patients receiving epinephrine had significantly lower rates of survival at one month (5.1 versus 7.0 percent); survival with moderate or good cerebral performance (1.3 versus 3.1 percent); and survival with no, mild, or moderate neurological disability (1.3 versus 3.1 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results were reported from a study of 1646 patients presenting to a single center between 2000 and 2012 following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation, in which the chance of survival was significantly lower among patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and decreased further as the cumulative dose of epinephrine during resuscitation increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The early administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> within two minutes following the initial defibrillation for <span class=\"nowrap\">VF/VT</span> may be detrimental. In a prospective cohort study of 2978 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest and a shockable rhythm (1510 patients with epinephrine administered within two minutes of defibrillation and 1468 propensity score matched patients without early epinephrine administration), patients who received early epinephrine had a significantly decreased likelihood of survival (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.59-0.82) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The 2010 AHA guidelines recommended that a single dose of 40 units of vasopressin may be administered in place of the first or second dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> in the treatment of a VF or pulseless VT arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, clear evidence that this approach is superior to epinephrine is lacking. Although a single randomized controlled trial found higher rates of successful resuscitation and 24-hour survival with vasopressin compared with epinephrine, subsequent randomized trials and a meta-analysis failed to show an improvement in initial ROSC or survival to hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Furthermore, in a multicenter trial of 1442 patients, treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a combination of epinephrine and vasopressin did not improve outcomes compared with treatment with epinephrine alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Chest compressions should not be stopped until the defibrillator is fully charged and the patient is ready for defibrillation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excellent CPR should be provided throughout the resuscitative effort until return of spontaneous circulation or termination of resuscitative efforts. Brief (10 second) pauses in CPR should only occur at two-minute intervals for rhythm analysis and defibrillation, if indicated. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The only definitively effective treatment of ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) is defibrillation, as VF and VT rarely, if ever, terminate spontaneously or after delivery of an antiarrhythmic drug. The chances of successful defibrillation, and survival, are greatest when defibrillation is performed early after the onset of VF or VT. However, while awaiting the arrival and setup of a defibrillator, CPR should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'VF and pulseless VT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Defibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VF and VT often persist despite defibrillation, or recur promptly after successful defibrillation. In such cases, intravenous antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be used, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> being the preferred antiarrhythmic drugs. Notably in the management of cardiac arrest, amiodarone did not provide any benefit when assessing the clinically relevant outcome of neurologically favorable survival as compared with lidocaine or placebo. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Antiarrhythmic drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with recurrent VF or pulseless VT thought to be due to torsades de pointes with a prolonged QT interval, the administration of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Magnesium sulfate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to SCA caused by VF or pulseless VT, there is no role for defibrillation in the management of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole. CPR and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> should be provided, with prompt efforts to identify any reversible causes of PEA or asystole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52416 \">table 1</a>).
