In contrast to long QT syndrome, another channelopathy, ion channel defects associated with SQTS lead to abnormal abbreviation of repolarization, predisposing affected individuals to a risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-the-long-qt-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of the long QT syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since its first report in 2000, significant progress has been made in defining the genetic and cellular basis of SQTS as well as in therapeutic approaches to treating this syndrome. SQTS is a genetically heterogeneous disease with six different genes encoding various cardiac ion channels thus far identified. Data regarding genotype-phenotype correlation and genotype-specific treatment are promising but limited, primarily due to the lack of clinical cases.</p><p>The clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and treatment modalities for SQTS will be discussed here. SCD and other channelopathies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1561601143\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND INITIAL REPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1993, it was first proposed that shorter than normal QT intervals (&lt;400 msec) are associated with a 2.4-fold increased risk for SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An abnormally short QT interval observed before and after runs of <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> has been reported anecdotally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Interestingly, certain species of kangaroo, known to have a high incidence of SCD, display an abnormally short QT interval as a normal feature on their electrocardiogram (ECG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>SQTS was first described as a clinical entity in a report of four patients with extremely short QT intervals in association with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In 2003, another study further described SQTS in two unrelated European families (six patients total) with a strong family history of sudden death in association with short QT interval on ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since then, over 100 cases of SQTS have been reported, and the existence of this novel channelopathy has been validated.</p><p>Abbreviation of the QT interval, the time elapsed between ventricular depolarization and repolarization, on the surface ECG is caused by a decrease in the action potential duration (APD) of ventricular myocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78354\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78354 \">figure 1</a>). The upper limit of the normal QT interval is now fairly well defined, but the lower limit of the normal QT interval and the value below which it could be considered arrhythmogenic remain unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The ECGs of the first few SQTS patients showed extremely short QT and QTc intervals of less than 300 msec. Since then, patients with SQTS with QT interval longer than 300 msec have been reported; however, in most cases the QT and QTc interval have been less than 360 msec. Yet the diagnosis of SQTS is complicated due to the overlapping QT range of affected individuals and apparently healthy individuals.</p><p>To define the lower limit of the QT interval, many experts refer to a comprehensive study that investigated the distribution of normal QT interval in 14,379 healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The study established the formula (Rautaharju's formula) by which the QT interval can be predicted as:</p><p>QT predicted (QTp) = <span class=\"nowrap\">656/(1+</span> heart <span class=\"nowrap\">rate/100)</span></p><p>The prevalence of QT interval shorter than 88 percent of QTp <span class=\"nowrap\">(QT/QTp</span> &lt;88 percent, which is equivalent to two standard deviations below the mean) was 0.03 percent. Based on this observation, it was suggested that QT intervals less than 88 percent of QTp (two standard deviations below mean predicted value) at a particular heart rate may be considered as short QT intervals. For example, at a heart rate of 60 beats per minute (bpm), per Rautaharju's formula, QTp would be 410 msec. Eighty-eight percent of QTp (410 msec) would be 360 msec. QT interval values less than 80 percent of QTp may be considered extremely short (which is equivalent to 330 msec at a heart rate of 60 beats per minute) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. </p><p>Clinical experience clearly indicates that the vast majority of patients with QTc values in the 330 to 360 range are not at risk, although a select few may be. (See <a href=\"#H341687\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5697920\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF A SHORT QT INTERVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the epidemiologic data available for many other electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, including long QT intervals, the precise prevalence of a short QT interval in the general population is unknown but appears to be 2 percent or less when using a cutoff of 360 msec. This is largely the case due to the long-standing failure to identify any risk associated with shorter-than-normal QT intervals as well as the varying definitions of what constitutes a shorter-than-normal QT interval.</p><p>Several large cohorts have attempted to identify the frequency of short QT interval in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. The precise definition of a short QT has varied slightly in each of the cohorts, but in all of the studies, patients classified as having a short QT interval had a rate-corrected QTc of 369 msec or less. The prevalence was estimated as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Finnish cohort of 10,822 middle-aged (mean 44 years) patients, 0.4 percent had a short QTc interval (&lt;340 msec), and 0.1 percent had a very short QTc interval (&lt;320 msec) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Swiss cohort of 41,767 army conscripts (99.6 percent male, mean age 19 years), 1 percent had a short QTc interval (&lt;347 msec), and 0.02 percent had a very short QTc interval (&lt;320 msec) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an American cohort of 46,129 healthy volunteers (53 percent female), 2 percent had a QTc interval &le;360 msec [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Japanese cohort of 114,334 patients with ECGs stored in an electronic database, 0.37 percent were found to have short QTc intervals (&le;357 msec in males, &le;364 msec in females) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1561601157\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC BASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SQTS is a genetically heterogeneous disease with mutations in seven different genes (three gain of function and four loss of function) that encode different cardiac ion channels and a carnitine transporter, having been identified and termed SQT1 to SQT7 based on the chronology of their discovery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72304 \">table 1</a>). SQT1 and SQT3-7 have been reported in familial setting, and SQT2 is reported only in a single patient in a sporadic setting. SQTS traits are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Many of the genes involved in SQTS are the same as those responsible for LQTS; however, the net effect of the mutations in SQTS is to increase repolarizing forces, an effect opposite to that encountered in LQTS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-congenital-and-acquired-long-qt-syndrome#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of congenital and acquired long QT syndrome&quot;, section on 'Types of congenital LQTS'</a>.)</p><p>The largest available case series of SQTS describes the clinical presentation of 29 patients with SQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The most common form of SQTS (SQT1) was linked to mutations in KCNH2, the gene encoding the &alpha;-subunit of the rapid delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel (I<sub>Kr</sub>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70771 \">figure 2</a>). Approximately 25 percent of patients had a mutation in <em>KCNH2</em>, and no mutation was found in the rest of the patients. Mutations in <em>KCNQ1</em> and <em>KCNJ2</em> were not detected, and <em>CACNA1c,</em> <em>CACNB2b, and CACNA2D1</em> were not screened.</p><p>The N588K mutation in <em>KCNH2</em> was first identified in three separate families with shorter than normal QT intervals and a high incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>]. Patch clamp analysis of N588K revealed this mutation completely removed inactivation over a physiological range of potentials, resulting in a dramatic increase in I<sub>Kr</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. A second mutation at T618I in <em>KCNH2</em> has been discovered and linked to SQT1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Interestingly, a novel mutation, R1135H in <em>KCNH2</em>, has been identified in a patient with short QT interval as well as a Brugada-type ECG, suggesting that SQTS may also present with other channelopathies. </p><p>Indeed, many SQTS patients carrying mutations in the L-type calcium channel genes (<em>CACNA1C, CACNB2</em> and <em>CACNA2D1</em>) manifest an ST segment elevation on the surface electrocardiogram in addition to a shorter than normal QT interval and appear to have a combined <span class=\"nowrap\">Brugada/Short</span> QT syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Most patients harboring a calcium channel mutation who display normal QT intervals have been shown to carry secondary genetic variations that are known to prolong the QT interval. QT-prolonging variations (p.D601E-<em>CACNB2b, </em>p.K897T-<em>KNCH2, </em>p.T10M-<em>KCNE2, </em>p.R1047L<em>-KCNH2, </em>p.D76N<em>-KCNE1, </em>p.G643S<em>-KCNQ1) </em>were found in 12 of the 14 BrS probands presenting with a normal QTc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Initially, only mutations in genes encoding the cardiac potassium and calcium channels were implicated in SQTS. However, a subsequent report provides evidence that a disturbance of long-chain fatty acid metabolism can influence the morphology and the electrical function of the heart, leading to development of SQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In this case series, three patients affected by primary systemic carnitine deficiency presented with SQTS associated with ventricular fibrillation. Primary carnitine deficiency is a rare (1:50,000) autosomal recessive disorder caused by defective transport of carnitine into the cell, in which mutations in SLC22A5 have been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Administration of oral DL-carnitine or L-carnitine (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> over a period of months abolished the electrocardiographic and arrhythmic manifestations of the syndrome. Additional evidence in support of the relationship between carnitine deficiency and SQTS was obtained by using a mouse model of&nbsp;carnitine&nbsp;deficiency&nbsp;induced by long-term subcutaneous perfusion of MET88 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Previous studies have reported that the absence of long-chain fatty acids leads to an increase in the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel current (I<sub>Kr</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], which may participate in the abbreviation of the QT interval in primary carnitine deficiency. This study suggests that long-chain fatty acids can directly regulate I<sub>Kr</sub>. The effects of Class III antiarrhythmic agents have not been tested either in humans with primary carnitine deficiency or in the mouse model of the syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders#H3724086895\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific fatty acid oxidation disorders&quot;, section on 'Carnitine transporter deficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175416\"><span class=\"h1\">CELLULAR BASIS OF ARRHYTHMOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The QT interval is determined by the ventricular action potential duration, which in turn is dependent upon a delicate balance of currents active during the repolarization phase of the action potential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78354\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78354 \">figure 1</a>). An increase in net outward current due to either a reduction in inward depolarizing currents like I<sub>Ca</sub> (SQT4- SQT6) or augmentation of outward repolarizing currents such as I<sub>Kr </sub>(SQT1), I<sub>Ks</sub> (SQT2), I<sub>K1</sub> (SQT3), or a combination thereof, can shift the balance of current favoring early repolarization, thus leading to abbreviation of action potential duration, refractoriness, and QT interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70771\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70771 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Available data suggest that abbreviation of the action potential in SQTS is heterogeneous with preferential abbreviation of either epicardial or endocardial cells as compared with subendocardial M cells, resulting in tall, positive T waves on the ECG and an increase in transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Dispersion of repolarization serves as substrate, and abbreviation of wavelength (product of refractory period and conduction velocity) promotes the initiation and maintenance of reentry under conditions of SQTS. </p><p>The trigger responsible for generating the premature beat that precipitates polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in SQTS is not known but may involve a phase 2 reentry or late phase 3 early afterdepolarization mechanism, which may give rise to R-on-T extrasystoles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Alternatively, re-excitation of the ventricles from the Purkinje fiber network may initiate the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/21,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,34</a>].</p><p>In the experimental setting, shortening of the action potential duration (and thus QT interval) results in a reduction in contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. However, reports have shown that while electrical repolarization in SQTS patient is abbreviated, mechanical contraction is not, suggesting an electromechanical dissociation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>A gain-of-function mutation augments outward potassium current in SQT1-3, and a loss-of-function mutation reduces I<sub>Ca </sub>in SQT4-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/20,24,25,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24,25,38,39</a>]. T<sub>peak</sub>-T<sub>end</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/QT</span> ratio, an electrocardiographic index of spatial dispersion of repolarization, is significantly augmented in most cases of SQTS, suggesting an increase in TDR at the cellular level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Interestingly, this ratio is more amplified in patients who are symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The increase in TDR is known to predispose to phase 2 reentry and may be responsible for the closely-coupled premature ventricular extrasystole that precedes the onset of polymorphic VT in SQTS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1561601164\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of SQTS is variable, and many patients are asymptomatic.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is very common in patients with SQTS; thus, diagnosis of SQTS should be considered in young individuals with lone atrial fibrillation with shorter than normal QT intervals.

PQ depression was most commonly seen in leads II, V3, aVF, V4, and I (67, 47, 42, 39, and 39 percent of SQTS patients, respectively). The presence of PQ depression in asymptomatic patients or those with syncope or an arrhythmia should prompt close scrutiny of the QT interval for the possibility of a short QT interval. PQ dispersion in this setting is thought to reflect spatial dispersion of repolarization within the atria.</p><p>In cases of SQT4, 5, and 6, short QT intervals may appear together with a Brugada type ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads V1-V3 at baseline or after administration of a potent sodium channel blocker (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51616\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51616 \">waveform 1</a>) or other unmasking agent, such as a potassium channel opener (I<sub>KATP</sub> activator) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

As a consequence, QT correction using Bazett's or comparable formulas (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-qt-interval-correction-ekg\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) will overcorrect at initially fast rates, leading to a false negative diagnosis.

A scoring system was developed based on ECG characteristics, clinical presentation, family history, and genetic findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65743 \">table 2</a>).

Strong parasympathetic stimulation can lead to bradycardia and concurrent activation of myocardial acetylcholine-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels (K<sub>ACh</sub>).

Because the rate of serious complications of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy is not trivial, particularly over the life of a young patient, it is important to discriminate between patients with an isolated short QT interval and those who meet the criteria for SQTS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65743 \">table 2</a>). Prior to making a final decision regarding the management of these patients, acquired causes of a shortened QT interval should be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H175259\" class=\"local\">'Acquired causes of short QT interval'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3288843\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with an isolated short QT interval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials and few observational studies of patients assessing the prognosis of patients with isolated short QT intervals who have no apparent clinical history, family history, or genetic criteria suggestive of SQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. As such, the following management strategies for such patients are based on expert opinion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a short QT interval only (330 msec or greater) who have none of the clinical history, family history, or genotype criteria proposed for the diagnosis of SQTS are classified as low-probability for the diagnosis of SQTS.

We do suggest referral to an electrophysiologist for comprehensive testing, including genetic screening, if this has not yet been completed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3288858\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with a short QT interval who have a high probability of SQTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with a QT interval &lt;350 msec and at least one criterion from the list of clinical history, family history, or genotype criteria will be classified as high-probability for the SQTS. Because of the association between SQTS and sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmias, therapy with an ICD is recommended in these patients, along with consideration of antiarrhythmic therapy if appropriate shocks are frequent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1561601214\"><span class=\"h3\">Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SQTS are at a very high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As such, we recommend ICD implantation for both primary and secondary prevention of SCD in patients with SQTS unless absolutely contraindicated or refused by the patient. Because the sensitivity of inducibility of ventricular fibrillation (VF) is only 50 percent, failure to induce VF during EP study does not preclude future risk of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/19,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,44</a>]. Accordingly, a negative EP study should not defer a clinician's decision to implant an ICD. The 2013 <span class=\"nowrap\">HRS/EHRA/APHRS</span> guidelines recommend ICD implantation as a class I indication in symptomatic patients with a diagnosis of SQTS who are survivors of a cardiac arrest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have documented spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia with or without syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-qt-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

The tall, peaked, and closely coupled T waves are often mistakenly sensed as R waves, leading to inappropriate ICD shocks. Reprogramming the decay delay, the sensitivity, or both generally prevents such inappropriate discharges. Caution must be exercised to avoid programming modifications that prevent the detection of lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

However, pharmacologic therapy may be the primary treatment modality in patients who refuse ICD placement, patients with an absolute contraindication to ICD placement, or in very young patients in whom ICD implantation is problematic. For patients with SQTS who have refused or are not candidates for ICD therapy, or in those with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias resulting in frequent ICD therapy, we recommend adjunctive pharmacologic therapy with QT-prolonging drugs. In the case of SQT1, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a> rather than a class IC or class III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 4</a>) antiarrhythmic drug.

(See <a href=\"#H1561601230\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H881529096\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-inherited-arrhythmia-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Inherited arrhythmia syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Cardiac implantable electronic devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1561601237\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) is an inherited channelopathy (disorder which affects the movement of ions through channels within the cell membrane) associated with marked shortening of QT intervals and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in individuals with structurally normal hearts. (See <a href=\"#H1561601136\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SQTS is a genetically heterogeneous disease, with mutations in seven different genes (three gain of function and four loss of function) that encode different cardiac ion channels and carnitine transporter, having been identified and termed SQT1 to SQT7 based on the chronology of their discovery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72304 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1561601157\" class=\"local\">'Genetic basis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of SQTS is variable, and while many patients are asymptomatic, the majority present with one or more of the following: SCD, palpitations, syncope, and atrial fibrillation. (See <a href=\"#H1561601164\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical electrocardiogram (ECG) findings associated with SQTS include an abnormally short QT interval (usually &lt;360 msec with a range of 220 to 360 msec), absence of the ST segment, tall and peaked T waves in the precordial leads, and poor rate adaptation of the QT interval. (See <a href=\"#H341508\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sole presence of a shorter than normal QT interval is not always diagnostic of SQTS and may represent a normal variant. Diagnostic criteria have been developed to facilitate the evaluation of individuals suspected to have SQTS, with a scoring system based on ECG characteristics, clinical presentation, family history, and genetic findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65743 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2323074656\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-degree relatives of those diagnosed with SQTS should undergo clinical screening with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and genetic testing. Mutation-specific genetic testing is recommended<strong> </strong>for all family members and relatives suspected of SQTS following the identification of the SQTS-causative mutation in an index case. Family members who test positive for the familial mutation should be seen by a cardiologist with expertise in SQTS to discuss further management. (See <a href=\"#H3633016551\" class=\"local\">'Screening family members'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before arriving at a diagnosis of SQTS, other potential causes for QT shortening should be excluded, including hyperkalemia, acidosis, hypercalcemia, hyperthermia, effect of drugs like digitalis, increased vagal tone, and deceleration-dependent shortening of QT interval. (See <a href=\"#H341687\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with a shortened QT interval varies depending on whether the short QT interval occurs in isolation or is associated with other clinical history, family history, or genetic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65743 \">table 2</a>) that increase the probability of SQTS. As discussed previously, the sole presence of a shorter-than-normal QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) does not appear to be diagnostic for the SQTS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a short QT interval only (330 msec or greater) who have none of the clinical history, family history, or genotype criteria proposed for the diagnosis of SQTS are classified as low-probability for the diagnosis of SQTS. For these low-probability patients, we suggest no specific pharmacologic or device-based therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a markedly shortened QT interval only (&lt;330 msec) are classified as intermediate-probability for the diagnosis of SQTS, despite having none of the clinical history, family history, or genotype criteria proposed for the diagnosis of SQTS. For these intermediate-probability patients, we suggest no specific pharmacologic or device-based therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We do refer to an electrophysiologist for comprehensive testing, including genetic screening, if this has not yet been completed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with SQTS are at a very high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). As such, we recommend implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation for both primary and secondary prevention of SCD unless absolutely contraindicated or refused by the patient (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1561601214\" class=\"local\">'Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>While pharmacologic therapy in patients with SQTS is primarily used as an adjunct to ICD placement, it may be the primary treatment modality in patients who refuse ICD placement, patients with an absolute contraindication to ICD placement, or in very young patients in whom ICD implantation is problematic. For patients with SQTS who have refused or are not candidates for ICD therapy, or in those with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias resulting in frequent ICD therapy, we recommend adjunctive pharmacologic therapy with a QT prolonging drug. In the case of SQT1, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a> rather than a class IC or class III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 4</a>) antiarrhythmic drug (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). This recommendation is based on the positive electrophysiologic effects of quinidine (eg, QT prolongation to the normal range) in patients with SQTS studied thus far.
