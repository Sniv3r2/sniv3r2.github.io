Deviations from normal head growth may be the first indication of an underlying congenital, genetic, or acquired problem (eg, congenital infection, genetic syndrome, hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage, storage disease, or neoplasm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/macrocephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Many genetic conditions are associated with an abnormal pattern of head growth; the earlier these conditions are detected, the earlier appropriate treatment, services, and genetic counseling can be provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/macrocephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The etiology and evaluation of macrocephaly in infants and children will be discussed here.

Changes in the volume of any component before the closure of the fontanelles and sutures may alter the occipitofrontal circumference (OFC). In contrast, changes in volume that occur after closure of the fontanelles and sutures bring about compensatory changes in the other components.

The diagnosis is complicated by limitations in accuracy of head circumference measurements and inconsistency between prenatal and postnatal head circumference growth curves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/macrocephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Although there are reference values for fetal head circumference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/macrocephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], standards have not been developed for specific populations (eg, based on sex, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity)</span>.</p><p>The approach to evaluation of prenatal macrocephaly depends upon the presence of associated ultrasonographic anomalies, appropriateness of other fetal biometric parameters (eg, length of bones, abdominal circumference) in relation to gestational age, historical features (eg, consanguinity, familial macrocephaly), and head circumference measurements of parents and siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/macrocephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Associated ultrasonographic anomalies (eg, callosal dysgenesis, malformations of cortical development, hypertelorism, enlarged kidneys, polydactyly, hypoplastic long bones) may indicate syndromic macrocephaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75193\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75193 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/macrocephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].
