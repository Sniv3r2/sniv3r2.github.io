Ultimately, these individuals may have unstable angina, non-ischemic cardiac pain, or non-cardiac pain.

Three major rest imaging modalities are available to evaluate patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging, echocardiography, and coronary computed tomographic angiography. We do not recommend the use of the coronary artery calcium score to evaluate chest pain in the ED, since absence of coronary artery calcium does not exclude an ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Such patients generally have no or minimal symptoms at rest or symptoms that have resolved, stable hemodynamics, a normal or nondiagnostic electrocardiogram and serial troponin results that are not elevated. Available tests include a traditional treadmill exercise tolerance test or stress (exercise or pharmacologic) imaging with <span class=\"nowrap\">nuclear/positron</span> emission tomography imaging, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3540534104\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH ONGOING SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For hemodynamically unstable patients, we often refer them for diagnostic coronary angiography rather than performing noninvasive testing. </p><p>For hemodynamically stable patients with ongoing chest pain, a nonischemic electrocardiogram, and troponin values that are not elevated, unstable angina (or an unusual presentation of stable angina) remains a diagnostic possibility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Unstable angina'</a>.)</p><p>We also refer many of these patients with possible unstable angina for coronary angiography, particularly if we think the likelihood of unstable angina is high. Patients with established cardiovascular disease or chest pain characteristic for angina pectoris fall into this group. </p><p><br/>Rest (no stress) cardiac imaging (see <a href=\"#H3810640697\" class=\"local\">'Rest imaging'</a> above) may be useful. However, rest imaging has not been widely adopted. If rest imaging is to be performed, the choice of test depends on local expertise and availability.</p><p>The rationale for rest imaging derives from the pathophysiologic events that follow the onset of myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When myocardial oxygen demand exceeds supply (due to either increased oxygen demand or reduced supply), the first abnormality detected is regional myocardial blood flow heterogeneity between the vascular beds supplied by normal and stenosed coronary arteries. This manifests as a regional perfusion defect on myocardial perfusion imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional systolic dysfunction (manifest as regional wall motion abnormalities) is highly specific for regional ischemia in patients without prior abnormality. Regional systolic dysfunction may be seen on 2D echocardiography.</p><p/><p>Since regional flow heterogeneity and systolic dysfunction precede chest pain in the ischemic cascade, the absence of these phenomena (ie, a normal rest study) in a patient with ongoing chest pain is reliable evidence of the nonischemic nature of the chest pain. Noninvasive imaging studies have demonstrated that regional flow heterogeneity has a higher sensitivity for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) while regional systolic dysfunction has a higher specificity. It should be kept in mind that an ACS may be present despite a noninvasive study with no wall motion abnormalities (WMA) and that a noninvasive study WMA may represent old infarction. </p><p>Rest imaging for patients with suspected ACS in the emergency department (ED) is among the most rigorously studied areas in terms of evidence for the use of imaging, with numerous randomized controlled trials involving many of the modalities. Large trials have been performed using rMPI and substantial observational data exist for 2D echocardiography, which can also offer insights about nonischemic causes of chest pain. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging requires provocative stress testing and placing the patient with active chest pain in the scanner for a prolonged period of time is not appropriate. </p><p>The utility of testing varies across these tests in relation to whether symptoms are ongoing or have resolved. The longer the interval between the end of symptoms and the test, the lower the sensitivity of the test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Assessment of wall motion abnormalities appears to require ongoing symptoms for optimal sensitivity (unless infarction has occurred). Perfusion or anatomic changes may persist for several hours or more despite resolution of symptoms. In general, we do not evaluate the patient with these rest studies if the patient has been pain free for more than two to three hours, but instead wait for a final troponin results and plan for stress testing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569997646\"><span class=\"h2\">Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have validated the benefit from the use of acute rest single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) rMPI in the evaluation of patients with chest pain and a non-diagnostic electrocardiograph (ECG). During rest rMPI with technetium (Tc)-99m sestamibi or Tc-99m tetrofosmin, the radiolabeled tracers accumulate in myocardial tissue in a degree proportional to myocardial blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. If these agents are injected during or shortly after resolution of chest pain, areas of ischemic myocardium demonstrate reduced radioactive counts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62918%7ECARD%2F80590\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62918 graphicRef80590 \">image 1A-B</a>). Because there is minimal redistribution of these agents over three to four hours, imaging can provide accurate information about myocardial perfusion at the time of injection even if the scintigraphy is delayed for a few hours after the injection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic properties of myocardial perfusion agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It must be emphasized that the lowest event rates are associated with scans that are completely normal. Equivocal scans are associated with event rates that are intermediate between those associated with normal and clearly abnormal scans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73446\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73446 \">table 1</a>). Thus, the interpretation of rMPI in ED patients should be geared towards obtaining maximum sensitivity and negative predictive value for potential disease by identifying and reporting any abnormality as significant.</p><p>Multiple studies have shown that patients with chest pain and normal images on acute rest rMPI can be safely discharged from the ED:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of this approach was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in which 2475 patients with suggestive chest pain within the previous three hours, a non-diagnostic ECG, and no prior MI were studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned to resting technetium-99m SPECT or to routine ED assessment. An ACS was subsequently confirmed in 329 patients (13 percent). Patients with negative serial enzymes, no evolutionary changes on serial ECGs, and a negative follow-up stress test were considered to have noncardiac chest pain. There was no difference in the appropriate admission rate between the SPECT group and the controls (97 versus 96 percent for acute MI and 83 versus 81 percent for unstable angina). However, among patients confirmed to have noncardiac chest pain, the erroneous admission rate was significantly lower for the SPECT group (42 versus 52 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The value of acute rest rMPI was evaluated in 532 consecutive patients presenting to an ED with a nondiagnostic ECG and a low to intermediate probability of an ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A positive rMPI was present in 32 percent and was the only multivariable predictor of MI and was the most important independent predictor of MI or revascularization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77324\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77324 \">figure 1</a>). The sensitivity of a positive scan for MI and for MI or revascularization was 93 and 81 percent, respectively; the negative predictive values were 99 and 95 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The value of rest imaging in identifying patients with ischemia was confirmed in a multicenter prospective trial in which Tc-99m tetrofosmin SPECT rMPI was performed in 357 patients who were admitted from the ED with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia but with a normal or nondiagnostic ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among 20 patients who subsequently had an acute MI, 18 had an abnormal scan (sensitivity 90 percent); the specificity was 60 percent. The reduced specificity was in part due to patients with positive scans who had coronary disease but no acute MI. Because so few patients had an MI, the positive predictive value was only 12 percent; however, the negative predictive value was 99 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53835\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53835 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4154695071\"><span class=\"h2\">Two-dimensional echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two-dimensional echocardiography is an accurate, noninvasive test that is able to detect evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction in patients with ongoing chest pain. Severe ischemia produces regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) that can be visualized echocardiographically within seconds of coronary artery occlusion (12&plusmn;5 and 19&plusmn;8 seconds in two series of patients evaluated during transient coronary occlusions induced by angioplasty) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. These changes occur prior to the onset of ECG changes or the development of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79335\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79335 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The RWMA reflects a localized decrease in the amplitude and rate of myocardial excursion, as well as a blunted degree of myocardial thickening and local remodeling.</p><p>Since ischemic RWMA develop prior to symptoms, chest pain in the absence of RWMA is likely not to be due to active myocardial ischemia. However, the converse is not true; the presence of RWMA does not establish the diagnosis of ischemia. There are a number of other causes of resting RWMA, including a prior infarction, focal myocarditis, prior surgery, and cardiomyopathy.</p><p>Thus, echocardiography for an ACS has a high sensitivity but a relatively lower specificity. These predictions were confirmed in a study of 180 patients with chest pain in the ED. The following findings were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RWMA were present in 27 of 29 patients with an acute MI (sensitivity 93 percent as two non-ST elevation MIs were not apparent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RWMA were indicative of acute MI in only 31 percent of 87 patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 88 patients without RWMA, only two (2.2 percent) subsequently &quot;ruled in&quot; for a non-ST elevation MI by cardiac enzymes.</p><p/><p>It may be impossible to distinguish RWMA due to acute ischemia from those due to a previous MI. One clue, the preservation of normal wall thickness and normal reflectivity, suggests an acute event, while a thin akinetic reflective segment suggests chronicity. Some authorities recommend utilization of left-sided contrast for better delineation of the endocardial border when standard views are difficult to interpret [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p><br/>Two-dimensional, resting transthoracic echocardiography has been shown to have high sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute MI (93 percent) and ACS (88 percent), and moderate specificity for acute MI (78 percent) and ACS (53 percent) using regional dysfunction as the criteria for abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/15,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17-20</a>]. The performance characteristics of echocardiography are less optimal for the detection of ACS compared with acute MI, while the ED physician faced with a decision on patient disposition is interested in identifying all ACS including unstable angina as well as acute MI.</p><p>The predictive value of resting echocardiography within four hours of ED presentation was demonstrated in a study of 260 patients presenting to the ED with possible ACS found that rest echocardiography predicted cardiac events (including acute MI and revascularization) with 91 percent sensitivity and 75 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. When patients with abnormal ECGs were excluded, the sensitivity and specificity of rest echocardiography for predicting cardiac events was similar (85 and 74 percent, respectively). Other studies indicate that echocardiography performed after resolution of symptoms is unlikely to predict cardiac events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The use of contrast agents can enhance endocardial detection for assessment of regional wall motion. Use of contrast agents to assess myocardial perfusion has also been investigated and found to be useful but expertise is not widely available, especially in the emergency setting. Additionally, echo contrast agents have not been approved for perfusion imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A potential advantage of use of echocardiography in the ED setting is its ability to detect complications of MI as well as evidence of other causes of acute chest pain such as proximal aortic dissection, acute pericarditis, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary embolism, which may manifest echocardiographically as dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle and increased pulmonary artery pressure. Limitations of this approach include the fact that many patients become asymptomatic by the time of the test, thus decreasing its sensitivity; a normal test does not exclude important CAD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2337951507\"><span class=\"h2\">rMPI versus echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both rMPI and echocardiography may be useful for the patient with ongoing symptoms. The strength of evidence supporting a management strategy of potential ED discharge with a normal resting study may be higher with rMPI, based on the larger populations that have been reported and the consistently high negative predictive value compared with rest echo.</p><p>The choice between these two should be made based on local expertise, availability, and cooperation among the various stakeholder groups, including ED physicians, cardiologists, and imaging specialists. We believe that echocardiography is less useful in patients whose symptoms have resolved. Another advantage for rMPI is that imaging can be deferred for up to four hours after the injection of a Tc-99m tracer, making test logistics easier in busy departments.</p><p>Few studies directly compare rMPI and echocardiography in patients with ongoing chest pain. A study of 470 patients classified as having low to intermediate risk of ACS found that rest rMPI and rest echocardiography had similar sensitivities and specificities for prediction (ie, prognosis) of acute MI or coronary intervention (sensitivity 100 percent for both, specificity 89 percent for rMPI, and 86 percent for echocardiography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-testing-and-imaging-for-diagnosis-in-patients-at-low-to-intermediate-risk-for-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Rest rMPI and rest echocardiography also performed similarly for prediction of acute MI, significant coronary artery stenosis, or positive stress rMPI (sensitivity 75 percent for both, specificity 88 percent for echocardiography, and 90 percent for rMPI). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3693552444\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac computed tomographic angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) should not be performed in patients with ongoing chest pain who may have ACS since transporting them is unsafe and radiology suites are generally not equipped to deal potentially unstable patients. CCTA is discussed elsewhere.

We see no advantage of preferring this test in patients who can have 2D echocardiography or acute rest SPECT rMPI performed. While CMR can provide comprehensive information, the literature on its use in ED chest pain patients emanates from a small number of expert centers. In most centers it is likely that rMPI or echo would be more readily available on short notice, and that expertise is more likely present. The test requires transfer of the patient from the ED, which we are reluctant to perform in some cases. </p><p>CMR imaging may be helpful in diagnosing particular cases, such as suspected myocarditis, though this is often suspected after ACS due to CAD is ruled out.
