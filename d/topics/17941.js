RV has a range of disease severity; in some patients, it is associated with substantial morbidity and an increased risk of mortality and can require intensive immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p>RV typically occurs in patients with longstanding, erosive RA and may affect a wide range of blood vessel types, from medium-sized muscular arteries to somewhat smaller arterioles or post-capillary venules. Clinical features of both medium- and small-vessel disease may be found within a given patient, and RV is generally classified among the forms of vasculitis associated with systemic diseases rather than based upon the size of the vessels involved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-and-approach-to-the-vasculitides-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of and approach to the vasculitides in adults&quot;, section on 'Vasculitis associated with systemic disease'</a>.)</p><p>RV may lead to blood vessel occlusion, necrosis, and tissue ischemia in a manner that resembles other forms of systemic vasculitis. In its tendency to affect medium-sized arteries and involve the skin, peripheral nerves, eyes, heart, muscles, and other organs, RV often has a clinical appearance similar to polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Treatment practices for RV have been adapted from those for other better studied forms of systemic vasculitis, particularly granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegener's), with which it also shares a number of features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of RV is presented here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of RV are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In determining treatment approaches for the patient with rheumatoid vasculitis (RV), an understanding of the clinical context in which this extraarticular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) occurs is essential. The typical patient with RV has suffered from RA for at least a decade before systemic vasculitis becomes apparent. Consequently, at the time of RV onset, intensive and potentially toxic treatments will often be required in patients who have already incurred considerable morbidity from RA and its therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of RV should usually have been confirmed by biopsy or by angiography prior to initiating immunosuppressive therapies, such as glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. In selected patients with organ- or life-threatening disease, it is occasionally necessary to perform the diagnostic procedure after treatment has been begun or before the results are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Successful management of RV requires balancing the risks and benefits of therapies required for its treatment. Treatment considerations are often complicated by comorbidities that patients with RV have sustained through the years, including cytopenias, renal dysfunction, hepatic damage, gastrointestinal ulceration, and the complications of glucocorticoids, including hypertension, glucose intolerance, skin fragility, and others. RV is also mimicked by a number of infections, including both viral (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, herpes zoster) and bacterial (tuberculosis, endocarditis) etiologies that must be excluded before initiating immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The type, distribution, and severity of organ damage resulting from RV are collectively weighed to determine appropriate treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated cutaneous involvement generally has a good prognosis and often does not require immunosuppressive drug therapy beyond glucocorticoids. However, some forms of cutaneous vasculitis, particularly some vasculitis-induced skin ulcers, may require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, or another immunosuppressive agent to induce disease remission. Even in these more limited cases of RV, glucocorticoid-sparing agents may be needed because of the burden of glucocorticoid-related side effects, especially when longer courses or higher doses of these agents are necessary. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous vasculitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic RV with involvement of internal organs, muscle, or peripheral nerves has a poorer prognosis and warrants immunosuppressive treatment, typically with initially high doses of glucocorticoids in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Systemic vasculitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The management of medications the patient is already receiving for RA depends upon the clinical manifestations and the planned therapy (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Systemic vasculitis'</a> below). As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who develop systemic RV while on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), the further use of MTX depends upon whether the patient is going to be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> for their RV. Patients treated with rituximab are typically continued on MTX, the dosing of which should be optimized; patients who are treated with cyclophosphamide should discontinue MTX before starting cyclophosphamide treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H3981583\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy with methotrexate'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who develop cutaneous or systemic RV while being treated with a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor should generally discontinue the TNF inhibitor. The use of these agents has been infrequently associated with the development of a drug-induced vasculitis, which is limited to the skin in the majority of the patients. Some patients with cutaneous vasculitis may not need further intervention for their vasculitis if it resolves with the discontinuation of the TNF inhibitor, which is common in patients with cutaneous vasculitis induced by the drug. We also discontinue the TNF inhibitor when treating systemic vasculitis with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-induction-of-antibodies-autoantibodies-and-autoimmune-diseases#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Induction of antibodies, autoantibodies, and autoimmune diseases&quot;, section on 'Vasculitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Autopsy studies have identified a substantially higher prevalence of RV than is clinically apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]; thus, there are likely to be individuals with early RV who could benefit from earlier treatment. The incidence of RV appears to be decreasing since the 1980s, suggesting that prompt and more aggressive treatment strategies and more effective medications may help to prevent the development of RV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Because RV is associated with anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies and other extraarticular disease, particular vigilance for RV is warranted in patients with these characteristics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis#H20512295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CUTANEOUS VASCULITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated nailfold infarctions can be treated symptomatically and with local measures and have a good prognosis, while leg ulcerations due to rheumatoid vasculitis (RV) may require treatment similar to that used for systemic involvement. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Isolated nailfold infarctions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Leg ulceration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolated nailfold infarctions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of isolated nailfold infarctions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74000\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74000 \">picture 1</a>), which are often associated with rheumatoid nodulosis and due to a low-grade small-vessel vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], depends upon whether they are painful and if there is skin breakdown. Such lesions can simply be observed in patients with minimal or no symptoms and intact skin, since there is a low risk for progression to systemic RV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In patients with painful nailfold infarction or infarcts with superficial skin breakdown, we suggest symptomatic treatment including bandaging and topical analgesics. If bandaging is insufficient to alleviate symptoms or the superficial ulceration does not show improvement over several days, we have had good success with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate (0.05% ointment applied daily at bedtime) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Topical clobetasol may be applied once or twice daily for up to 14 days, depending upon severity and the duration of therapy needed to achieve clearing of the lesions.</p><p>Long-term follow-up in 30 patients with nailfold vasculitis supports this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although patients with isolated nailfold vasculitis are at increased risk for other types of extraarticular disease, systemic therapy is not required for these lesions. They do not herald the imminent development of systemic RV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Leg ulceration</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1820689061\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial ulcer management with topical measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of systemic RV, the initial treatment of leg ulcerations should include an approach similar to that for skin ulcers due to venous stasis, with a focus on good wound care and appropriate use of systemic antibiotics for superinfection. The treatment of venous stasis ulcers is discussed in more detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>). Briefly, our approach to topical and local therapy in the patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and presumed RV is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with eschar, we use wet-to-moist saline dressings to debride the ulcer to a base of granulation tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In those with adequate arterial circulation, we use compression bandages or stockings to help reduce swelling if there is concomitant venous stasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use occlusive hydrocolloid (or hydrogel) dressings or, for patients with very exudative ulcers, calcium alginate-containing dressings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use topical glucocorticoids only on smaller lower-extremity ulcers, less than one centimeter in diameter, and particularly on digital ulceration. However, their efficacy for skin ulcers due to RV has not been formally evaluated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not use antibiotic-containing ointments or creams.</p><p/><p>A majority of leg ulcers in patients with RA probably have a vascular insufficiency etiology, which supports use of this approach, and the ulceration of RV can appear very similar. One series of 36 patients with RA and leg ulcers from Germany found three with RV, two with pyoderma gangrenosum, and 15 with chronic venous insufficiency, peripheral arterial disease, or a combination of these [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The duration of therapy with local and topical measures depends upon the severity of the ulcer and the adequacy of the response to these treatments. In the absence of other signs of systemic vasculitis, we have a low threshold for obtaining a biopsy of isolated non-healing ulcers as a basis for determining the need for further immunosuppressive therapy. Ulcers that do not respond to conservative measures may signal the presence of underlying RV or another etiology, including cutaneous malignancy or infection (including herpes zoster), which can present with skin ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Isolated skin ulceration greater than one centimeter across, or extending deeply to the fascia, should be biopsied early (within one to two weeks of appearance), to determine if systemic immunosuppressive therapies are warranted; whereas small, isolated, lower-extremity ulcers in older patients may merit up to four weeks of conservative management before pursuing a biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatoid vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2369791484\"><span class=\"h3\">Ulcers resistant to initial topical measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with ulcers resistant to topical measures alone require systemic therapy in addition to the local measures. Only very small ulcers are managed only topically (see <a href=\"#H1820689061\" class=\"local\">'Initial ulcer management with topical measures'</a> above). For patients who have systemic RV and skin ulcerations, as well as those with multiple progressively worsening skin ulcers but without systemic disease, immunosuppressive therapy, as well as local skin care, is usually essential for healing (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Systemic vasculitis'</a> below). Conservative wound care measures are continued through the course of therapy until re-epithelialization is complete. (See <a href=\"#H1820689061\" class=\"local\">'Initial ulcer management with topical measures'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with skin ulcers resistant to topical measures, as in other patients with systemic RV, the diagnosis of RV should usually have been confirmed by biopsy prior to initiating immunosuppressive therapies, such as glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Systemic vasculitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with multiple, small (typically less than 1 cm in diameter), but progressively worsening skin ulcers and who have no other evidence of systemic RV, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily, depending upon severity and response to therapy, taken orally), rather than intravenous pulse glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Topical therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> has been proposed for refractory ulcers, but its efficacy and role in management of vasculitic skin ulcers is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Resistant to medical therapy </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Patients whose skin ulcers do not respond to topical therapy and systemic immunosuppression are candidates for skin grafting. Pinch skin grafts appear to be similarly effective in healing ulcers in RA patients with or without biopsy evidence of cutaneous vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H165829511\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous vasculitis during use of TNF inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies have been linked to the development of cutaneous vasculitis in some patients with RA, the types of vasculitis reported with TNF inhibitors are generally mild, resemble an immune complex-mediated vasculitis, and usually resolve with discontinuation of the drug. There is no indication that the use of TNF inhibitors predisposes patients to the development of RV, and systemic necrotizing vasculitis is infrequent among patients with TNF inhibitor-related vasculitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-induction-of-antibodies-autoantibodies-and-autoimmune-diseases#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: Induction of antibodies, autoantibodies, and autoimmune diseases&quot;, section on 'Vasculitis'</a>.)</p><p>In RA patients who develop vasculitis while on TNF inhibitor therapy, we stop the TNF inhibitor, then monitor the patient closely for the first two to four weeks to see if discontinuation of the anti-TNF agent is associated with remission of the RV manifestations. This approach may be used if the vasculitis manifestation is a rash, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> should be used if there are ulcers or impending ulcers (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous vasculitis'</a> above). For more severe cutaneous disease or other potentially organ-threatening manifestations, such as mononeuritis multiplex, patients may be treated, if necessary, with daily oral glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone, started at 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily, then tapered as tolerated following resolution of the cutaneous changes), depending upon the response following discontinuation of the anti-TNF agent. More aggressive immunosuppression is usually not needed in these patients.

However, treatment decisions must be tailored to the clinical circumstances of each individual patient. The goal of treatment of systemic RV is to achieve a remission characterized by an absence of active vascular inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H3737639413\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring of response'</a> below.)</p><p>As with other forms of systemic vasculitis, active disease must be distinguished from damage. &ldquo;Damage&rdquo; is defined as injuries to a given organ that are likely permanent, which have occurred as a result of the underlying disease process, and which will not be reversible with immunosuppressive therapy. Common forms of damage in RV include the sequelae of peripheral nerve infarctions (eg, foot- or wrist-drop), scleral thinning caused by scleritis, and cutaneous scarring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82099\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82099 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Information specifically related to the treatment of systemic RV, contained in individual case reports or case series, suggests that most patients should be treated with a regimen similar to that used in forms of primary systemic vasculitis, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). The comparisons are imperfect, because GPA and PAN often affect the kidneys, and GPA affects the lungs and sinuses, all organs that are not as commonly involved in RV. However, in general, a similar treatment regimen is used in patients with RV in whom randomized trials comparing therapies have not been performed.

This French registry, involving 88 French centers and 1994 patients with RA treated with rituximab, included 10 women and seven men with active systemic RV who were treated with rituximab (given in either two or four infusions).

Four of the patients (24 percent) had received cyclophosphamide previously for their vasculitis and were being treated for relapse. After six months, 12 patients (71 percent) receiving rituximab had achieved complete remission of the vasculitis, four patients responded partially, and one patient died from uncontrolled vasculitis. Six patients (35 percent) were retreated at six months.

This hazard of infection when using high-dose glucocorticoids emphasizes the need to carefully determine if the RV is limited to the skin, thereby requiring minimal additional therapy (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous vasculitis'</a> above), versus the less common but much more threatening involvement of internal organs. In the previously cited study of 32 RV patients, most of whom were treated with cytotoxic drugs and glucocorticoids, more than one-third died within the first three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Rare patients with large-vessel vasculitis are thought to have a much worse prognosis; they may have an increased likelihood of mononeuritis multiplex or cerebral vasculitis, visceral infarction, or coronary arteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. By contrast, isolated nailfold infarctions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74000\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74000 \">picture 1</a>), which are often associated with rheumatoid nodulosis, may cause no further symptoms and can simply be observed since there is a low risk for progression to systemic RV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-rheumatoid-vasculitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The frequency of relapse is variable and may be determined, in part, by the intensity and duration of initial therapy.
