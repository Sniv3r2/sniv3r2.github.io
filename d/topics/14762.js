Radiation-associated sarcomas have been reported to occur as early as a few months following completion of radiation therapy (RT), to as long as 54 years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In most adult series, the average duration between RT and diagnosis of a secondary sarcoma ranges from 7 to 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/10,19,28,30,33,40,41,49-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19,28,30,33,40,41,49-59</a>]. Among breast cancer survivors, the average latency period for secondary post-radiation breast sarcomas is 10 to 11 years, but it is variable and tends to be shorter (four to eight years) for angiosarcomas. A secondary angiosarcoma has been reported as early as 14 months following breast irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

In this series, leiomyosarcomas were the most common histology, and the majority were diagnosed 30 or more years after the retinoblastoma treatment. </p><p>A latency period is necessary to differentiate a radiation-associated sarcoma from a primary sarcoma that is unrelated to RT. However, there is no consensus as to the interval to distinguish the two. This subject is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H167835885\" class=\"local\">'Latency period'</a> below.)</p><p>The development of a radiation-associated sarcoma may be influenced by factors such as dose, age at initial exposure, exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (particularly alkylating agents), and genetic tendency. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709392528\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation dose and age of exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of a radiation-associated sarcoma increases with the dose of radiation, as the post-radiation observation period lengthens, and with younger age at the time RT was administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/22,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,64,65</a>]. </p><p>Sarcoma appears to be a complication of high-dose therapy; it is rarely seen after low doses (&lt;40 Gy). To induce a tumor, the radiation dose must be great enough to cause genetic damage but not so great that it kills the cell. This often happens to tissues that are near the edge of the radiation field. Above a certain &quot;curative&quot; dose, cells theoretically lose their proliferative potential along with their carcinogenic capacity. However, there is great uncertainty concerning the risk for radiation-associated carcinogenesis at high doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. While some animal and human data suggest a decrease in secondary sarcomas at very high doses, other data suggest a plateau in risk. A systematic review of epidemiologic studies of the radiation dose-response relationship concluded that there was little evidence that the dose-response curve was nonlinear in the direction of a downturn in risk with higher RT doses, even at organ doses &ge;60 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>It is also not known whether newer radiation techniques such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT; which decreases the volume of normal tissue exposed to high RT doses, but increases the volume exposed to lower doses of irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]) or hypofractionated regimens may influence the risk of a radiation-associated sarcoma. Similarly, the use of partial breast irradiation may help limit this and other toxicities of breast irradiation.

This was shown in a systematic evaluation of secondary sarcomas after any first cancer in a report derived from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry of patients surviving at least one year after an initial non-sarcoma cancer diagnosed at age 20 to 79 between 1973 and 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Of the approximately 1.9 million adulthood cancer survivors, there were 1342 secondary soft tissue sarcomas and 314 secondary bone sarcomas diagnosed after an average follow-up of 13 years. The observed number of sarcomas was compared with the expected number of sarcomas in the general population, which was estimated using age and sex-specific incidence rates, and standardized incidence ratios were calculated as the observed divided by the expected number of second sarcomas for patients who received RT versus those who did not. For both types of sarcoma, the SIRs were elevated for patients who received RT versus those who did not, and the difference increased with increasing time since diagnosis of the first cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F88921\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88921 \">table 2</a>).

Although findings on plain radiographs can suggest the diagnosis of malignancy by demonstrating cortical bone destruction or a mineralized soft tissue mass, the definition of tumor size and local intraosseous and extraosseous extent is most accurately achieved by cross sectional imaging, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In a series of 63 cases of radiation-associated sarcoma, the cross sectional imaging findings of secondary bone sarcomas included a soft tissue mass (96 percent), cortical bone destruction (83 percent), tumor matrix mineralization (48 percent), and a periosteal reaction (38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The presence of a soft tissue mass, particularly in combination with either bone destruction or tumour matrix mineralization is very suggestive of malignancy. </p><p>Although the definition of tumor size and local extent can be achieved using either CT or MRI, MRI is generally preferred because of its better delineation of soft tissue structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/34,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,94</a>].

Lymphangiosarcoma cannot be reliably distinguished from angiosarcoma based on immunohistochemistry or other pathological features, however, so the distinction between angiosarcoma and lymphangiosarcoma remains unclear. Lymphangiosarcomas of the upper extremity, breast, and axilla arising in women with chronic lymphedema after breast cancer therapy were initially described by Stewart and Treves, and this syndrome is now designated Stewart-Treves syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Although such women typically present with longstanding extensive arm edema after mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, it may occur after radiation therapy (RT) alone. In these cases, it results from axillary lymph node sclerosis, and as such, lymphangiosarcoma represents a secondary sarcoma, but it does not meet the criteria for a radiation-associated sarcoma.

The risks of reirradiation to normal tissue are considerably higher than in patients who have not previously been irradiated, and, hence, great care is required to limit the dose and volume to normal tissues at risk.

Of the 21 patients who underwent reirradiation with or without hyperthermia for macroscopic disease, the local relapse-free survival was 29 percent (6 of 21), and four of these patients remained alive at periods from 11 to 39 months.

There are no randomized trials addressing the benefit of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Some authors suggest that chemotherapy is not helpful, as it is in primary osteosarcoma, whereas others report that, provided local control is achieved, radiation-associated osteosarcomas treated with chemotherapy and surgery have a similar prognosis to primary osteosarcoma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Rizzoli Institute experience with 20 cases of radiation-associated osteosarcoma, patients received one preoperative cycle of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and a second cycle with cisplatin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> and methotrexate because of the total prior dose of doxorubicin for the primary malignancy; three postoperative cycles of cisplatin, ifosfamide, and methotrexate were given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-associated-sarcomas/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 11 years (range 7 to 22 years), nine patients remained disease free, 10 died from osteosarcoma, and one died from a third neoplasm (acute myeloid leukemia). Event-free survival was not significantly different from that achieved in 754 patients with conventional sporadic osteosarcoma who were treated in the same period with conventional treatment protocols, although overall survival was numerically worse (five-year event-free survival: 40 versus 60 percent, p = not statistically significant; five-year overall survival: 40 versus 67 percent, p&lt;0.01).

The sites of involvement were the craniofacial bones in six cases, the first cervical vertebra in one, the pelvic girdle in seven, and the extremities of long bones in nine. Three patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis. The aim of treatment was curative for 16 patients, and 14 had intensive chemotherapy before or after surgery. Fifteen patients achieved a complete remission. Overall and event-free survivals at eight years were 50 and 41 percent, respectively. In the subgroup of patients without metastases at diagnosis, the respective survival rates (57 and 48 percent, respectively) were slightly lower than those reported in series of patients with de novo osteosarcoma.

Although the use of radiation therapy (RT) increases the risk of a sarcoma compared with no irradiation, the absolute risk is low overall (1 percent or less). Children are more susceptible to radiation-associated sarcoma than are adults. (See <a href=\"#H110695228\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and histologic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most post-radiation soft tissue sarcomas are high grade, and they can be of a variety of histologies, the most common of which are <span class=\"nowrap\">undifferentiated/unclassified</span> soft tissue sarcoma (formerly called malignant fibrous histiocytoma [MFH] or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [UPS]), angiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. The most common sarcoma to occur after radiation therapy for breast cancer is angiosarcoma. In series that report them, radiation-associated bone sarcomas account for approximately 20 to 30 percent of radiation-associated sarcomas, and the most common histology is osteosarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H709392415\" class=\"local\">'Histologic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation-associated sarcomas have been reported to occur as early as a few months following completion of RT, to as long as 54 years. The average latency period in adults ranges from 7 to 16 years; it is shorter for children (5.5 to 12 years) and for angiosarcomas after breast cancer treatment (four to eight years). (See <a href=\"#H110695235\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The development of a radiation-associated sarcoma may be influenced by factors such as dose, age at initial exposure, exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (especially alkylating agents), and genetic tendency. (See <a href=\"#H709392528\" class=\"local\">'Radiation dose and age of exposure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H785738110\" class=\"local\">'Potential effect modifiers'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, radiation-related sarcomas present in a manner that is similar to sporadic primary sarcomas of the bone or soft tissue. However, the diagnosis is often delayed in part because radiation-associated sarcomas may be more difficult to identify by physical examination because of RT-associated tissue changes. (See <a href=\"#H337541883\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although findings on plain radiographs can suggest the diagnosis of malignancy by demonstrating cortical bone destruction or a mineralized soft tissue mass, the definition of tumor size and local intraosseous and extraosseous extent is most accurately achieved by cross sectional imaging, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"#H22943650\" class=\"local\">'Imaging evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of tissue is required to establish the diagnosis of a soft tissue or bone sarcoma. The diagnostic biopsy must be carefully planned to ensure that adequate tissue is obtained in a manner that does not compromise definitive therapy. Core needle biopsy is considered the preferred method to achieve an initial biopsy in most cases. (See <a href=\"#H22943770\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are as yet no specific molecular or pathologic markers to guide distinction between radiation-associated and sporadic sarcomas in the radiation field. The presumptive diagnosis of a sarcoma as radiation associated and not sporadic is made on the basis of criteria initially proposed in 1948 and subsequently modified (see <a href=\"#H167835845\" class=\"local\">'Radiation-associated versus sporadic sarcoma'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radiation must have been given previously, with the sarcoma arising in the area included within the 5 percent isodose line of the radiated field.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The histologic features of the original lesion and the post-radiation sarcoma should be different.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with inherited syndromes that predispose to sarcomas even in the absence of RT, such as Li-Fraumeni or Rothmund-Thomson, should be excluded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initially, the minimal latency period (time period in years between the initiation of RT and the histologic diagnosis of the second neoplasm) was suggested to be over five years, but subsequently, shorter time frames (at least three years) have been thought to be adequate. (See <a href=\"#H167835885\" class=\"local\">'Latency period'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lung is the predominant site of metastases for both soft tissue and bone sarcomas, whether primary or radiation-associated. CT of the chest is typically performed to detect pulmonary metastases in patients with either a soft tissue or bone sarcoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) or bone scan are recommended for patients with a bone sarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H167836860\" class=\"local\">'Staging workup'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis of patients with radiation-associated sarcomas is poorer than that of primary sarcomas. However, aggressive management is warranted because secondary sarcomas are potentially curable. (See <a href=\"#H110695263\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main treatment is surgery with wide local excision.
