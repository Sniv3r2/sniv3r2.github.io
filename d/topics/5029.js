An understanding of the normal sequence and patterns of tooth eruption is the foundation for identifying and treating children with abnormal dental development and optimizing their oral health. Distinguishing normal from pathologic dental development requires careful evaluation of the patient, including medical, dental, and family history; clinical examination; radiographic evaluation; and possibly special laboratory tests.</p><p>Problems in dental development and syndromes associated with abnormal dental development are reviewed here. The normal anatomy and development of human dentition are discussed separately.

The majority of natal teeth are the primary mandibular incisors and are not extra or supernumerary teeth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60962\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60962 \">image 1</a>). Natal teeth may be associated with a variety of syndromes including chondroectodermal dysplasia (Ellis-van Creveld syndrome), pachyonychia congenita, Sotos syndrome, and Hallermann-Streiff syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Treatment of natal teeth may involve observation, smoothing of the incisal edge (to prevent potential discomfort during breastfeeding and ulceration of the ventral tongue or the floor of the mouth [Riga-Fede disease]), or extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Extraction of natal teeth should be considered only if they cause feeding difficulties for the infant or mother. Excessive natal tooth mobility has been considered to be a risk for aspiration.

Space deficiency in the dental arch frequently causes eruption failure (impaction) of the third molars, the maxillary canines, and the mandibular second premolars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Inadequate eruption space also can lead to eruption out of the normal position or ectopic eruption.</p><p>Inadequate space for eruption is treated with selective extraction of permanent teeth or orthodontic therapy, depending upon the severity and location of the space deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2144457202\"><span class=\"h3\">Widely spaced front teeth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Widely spaced maxillary central incisors (diastema) can result from a discrepancy in the size of the jaws and the teeth, or the labial frenum being attached to the alveolar ridge between the crowns of the central incisors.</p><p>Another cause of widely spaced front teeth is a mesiodens, a supernumerary tooth that is located between the maxillary central incisors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114763\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114763 \">image 2</a>).

Mesiodens in the primary dentition usually require extraction because they impede the eruption of the permanent incisors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1945491835\" class=\"local\">'Supernumerary teeth'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma to the anterior primary teeth can affect the development of the underlying permanent teeth and result in eruption failure of the permanent incisors. The development and eruption of permanent teeth should be monitored closely in children who have a history of trauma to the anterior primary teeth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of dental injuries in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Ankylosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ankylosis, or fusion of the developing teeth to the underlying bone, can arrest the normal process of tooth eruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a child who is still growing, the ankylosed tooth will be overgrown by the surrounding teeth that continue to erupt. Ankylosis should be suspected if a tooth fails to contact the teeth of the opposing arch when the teeth are brought into occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57748\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57748 \">image 3</a>). Ankylosis most often involves the first primary molars and is relatively common in the primary dentition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Ankylosed primary teeth typically exfoliate normally without treatment if they have a permanent successor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; however, treatment for ankylosis may be necessary depending upon the age of onset and severity of the problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cleidocranial dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/119600&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWB1lx0FzjxAgH3ZuB/OSqIaTkgjrNHhaFuiupGhU3jza&amp;TOPIC_ID=6276\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Cleidocranial dysplasia</a> is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by hypoplasia or aplasia of the clavicles, defective bone formation, short stature, supernumerary teeth, defective cementum formation, and abnormal permanent tooth eruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The failure of tooth eruption is thought to be caused by impedance of the migration of the permanent teeth toward the oral cavity by defects in the osteoclastic and resorptive activity of the alveolar bone. Cleidocranial dysplasia is caused by a mutation in the runt-related transcription factor 2 gene (<em>RUNX2</em>), a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors, located on chromosome 6p21. The <em>RUNX2</em> gene encodes core-binding factor alpha 1 (CFBA1) and is responsible for the initial differentiation of osteoblasts to form skeletal structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

They most commonly occur in the primary lower central incisors.</p><p>Double teeth can occur because of germination (a tooth bud attempts to form a second bud resulting in conjoined teeth) or fusion of two teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When double teeth are caused by fusion, the number of teeth is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Two adjacent teeth can be joined by enamel, dentin, or cementum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Joining through cementum (ie, concrescence) usually is related to trauma or abnormal position of one of the involved teeth.</p><p>Children with twinned teeth should be referred to a dental home so that they can be monitored for complications including delayed shedding and anomalies of the permanent dentition (eg, hypodontia, aplasia, impaction, supernumerary teeth, permanent twinned teeth) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">AGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tooth agenesis may be acquired or congenital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4241724010\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired tooth agenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acquired tooth agenesis can result from localized or generalized environmental insults (eg, trauma to a primary tooth, head and neck irradiation).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenitally missing teeth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenitally missing teeth may result from genetic disorders that affect the teeth in isolation or as part of a syndrome.</p><p>The prevalence of congenitally missing teeth varies by race and tooth type. Congenitally missing teeth are more common in the white population than in the black population (5 versus 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and in the permanent dentition than in the primary dentition. The maxillary lateral incisor and second premolar are the permanent teeth most frequently missing, and the mandibular central incisor is the primary tooth most frequently missing.</p><p>Many children with missing teeth have a family member with a similar history. Several specific genetic mutations for missing teeth have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. For example, a missense mutation in the <em>MSX1</em> gene that codes for a transcription factor can cause the autosomal dominant trait of missing lateral incisors and third molars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Congenitally missing teeth are a manifestation of numerous genetic syndromes. Some syndromes are associated with only a few missing teeth (eg, Down syndrome); other syndromes, such as the ectodermal dysplasias, are associated with multiple missing teeth (hypodontia) or complete absence of teeth (anodontia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Young children suspected of having missing teeth or abnormal eruption patterns should be referred for complete dental evaluations. The diagnosis of congenitally missing teeth is confirmed by the absence of a full dental complement on dental radiographs. Genetic testing can then be offered to determine if the molecular basis of the child's condition is known and to help establish recurrence risk, risk of potential associated health problems (eg, axis inhibitor 2 [<em>AXIN2</em>] mutations are associated with missing teeth and risk of colorectal cancer), and variability of expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The treatment for missing teeth varies and can require multiple therapeutic phases. Management of hypodontia or anodontia involves the use of prostheses or dental implants to replace the missing teeth and to enhance oral function and facial esthetics. Children who are missing multiple anterior teeth should receive their prostheses before beginning school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The optimal age for treatment is evaluated individually and determined by the extent of treatment needed and the child's ability to cooperate during the procedures and to maintain the appliances after placement. Dental implant procedures typically are delayed until the child reaches late adolescence or early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">EXFOLIATION PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature exfoliation of primary teeth can be caused by local factors or systemic health problems. The eruption of permanent teeth can cause the exfoliation of adjacent primary teeth. For example, two primary incisors can exfoliate when the large permanent incisor begins to erupt; the exfoliation of multiple primary teeth in place of one permanent tooth often indicates a tooth-arch size discrepancy and usually heralds crowding in the permanent dentition.</p><p>In addition, premature exfoliation of primary teeth can be associated with systemic conditions, such as hypophosphatasia, Langerhans histiocytosis, and cyclic neutropenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58443\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58443 \">table 1</a>). The lack of root resorption in the exfoliated primary tooth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114765\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114765 \">picture 1</a>) is a consistent clinical feature and an important clue to the diagnosis of systemic conditions that are associated with premature shedding of the primary teeth.</p><p>Children with premature exfoliation of the primary teeth must be evaluated to rule out serious systemic conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58443\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58443 \">table 1</a>) and should be referred to a pediatric dentist for prompt initiation of appropriate dental therapy.

The hypomineralization makes the teeth more susceptible to wear and breakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Mild fluorosis is indicated by a white flecked or lacy appearance to the enamel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63417\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63417 \">picture 2</a>); severe fluorosis is indicated by a brown discoloration.

Dentin malformations that affect the form and function of the teeth occur in syndromic and nonsyndromic hereditary conditions.</p><p>The dentinogenesis imperfectas and dentin dysplasias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77566 \">table 3</a>) are classified using clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/52,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Dentinogenesis imperfecta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) is classified according to its association with or without other conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I &ndash; Associated with osteogenesis imperfecta and type I collagen defects; diminished pulp chambers are characteristic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteogenesis-imperfecta-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteogenesis imperfecta: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II &ndash; Not associated with osteogenesis imperfecta; diminished pulp chambers are characteristic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III &ndash; Often associated with the Brandywine triracial isolate (a genetically isolated triracial population from southern Maryland); large pulp chambers in young teeth are characteristic. This form is allelic to DI type II and is really a phenotypic variant of DI type II and not a separate entity.</p><p/><p>In all types of DI, the teeth have a variable, opalescent blue-gray to yellow-brown discoloration caused by the abnormally colored dentin shining through the translucent enamel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68896\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68896 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>DI types II is an autosomal dominant condition and caused by mutations in the dentin sialophosphoprotein (<em>DSPP</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. It is interesting that the dental phenotypes of DI type I and type II are so similar. This is not surprising because DI type I is associated with type I collagen defects and DI type II is associated with <em>DSPP</em> mutations, and type I collagen and <em>DSPP</em> interact during the development and mineralization of dentin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Because the defective dentin in children who have DI is often unable to support the enamel, the enamel frequently fractures from the teeth, leaving them susceptible to rapid wear and attrition. The teeth affected by DI can be worn down to the gingiva if left untreated.</p><p>The treatment for DI depends upon the severity of discoloration and propensity for enamel loss. In children who do not have fracturing of the enamel, discoloration of the teeth can be treated with bonding; when severe fracturing of the enamel occurs, full coverage of the crowns typically is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Dentin dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two types of dentin dysplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77566 \">table 3</a>). Dentin dysplasia type I is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition with a frequency of 1:100,000 persons. Mutations in the <em>SSUH2</em> and <em>VPS4B</em> genes have been associated with dentin dysplasia type I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. The classic cascading waterfall dentin histopathology is thought to result from the cyclical process of premature odontoblast death, new odontoblast recruitment, dentin deposition, and odontoblast death. The crowns of affected teeth appear normal, but radiographs show short, blunted roots and pulpal obliteration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], resulting in teeth that are mobile, lost prematurely, and susceptible to abscess formation. No known treatment exists, but dental longevity can be increased by keeping occlusal forces to a minimum and avoiding orthodontic treatment for malalignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Dentin dysplasia type II also is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Mutations in the <em>DSPP</em> gene are associated with dentin dysplasia type II. Because they are caused by allelic mutations in the <em>DSPP</em> gene, the phenotype of dentin dysplasia type II and DI type II is identical in the primary teeth. They have yellow-brown to blue-gray discoloration and pulpal obliteration. The permanent dentition of children with dentin dysplasia type II is normally colored or only minimally discolored but has abnormal pulpal morphology and may be associated with pulp stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>The mechanism leading to different phenotypes in the permanent dentitions of these two conditions is not fully understood. However, one study that involved clinical and genetic evaluation of 23 members of a four-generation kindred, including 10 members with dentin defects, suggested dentin dysplasia type II and DI type II represent the mild and severe forms, respectively, of the same disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-defects-of-the-teeth/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Treatment of dentin dysplasia type II in the primary dentition is the same as that for DI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic conditions can be associated with abnormal dentin formation as a result of molecular defects that interfere with dentin developmental pathways. For example, because dentin is 60 percent mineral, systemic conditions that are associated with defects of mineralization (eg, hypophosphatasia and vitamin D-resistant rickets) affect dentin development. Other systemic conditions with dentin involvement include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the mucopolysaccharidoses, and tumoral calcinosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguishing normal from pathologic dental development requires careful evaluation of the patient, including medical, dental, and family history; clinical examination; radiographic evaluation; and possibly special laboratory tests.
