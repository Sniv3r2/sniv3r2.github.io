Effective treatment of hand burns requires a multifaceted and interdisciplinary approach that includes burn surgeons, plastic surgeons, rehabilitation physicians, and physical therapists.</p><p>The initial surgical approach to the patient with a burned hand, including the primary and secondary assessment and primary operative management, are discussed here. Surgical techniques used for primary coverage of burns (eg, skin grafts, free flaps) are also used for reconstruction of burns. The principles of reconstruction and operative procedures for secondary or delayed reconstruction of burns to the hands are reviewed elsewhere.

Information about the mechanism of injury and the circumstances surrounding the injury may provide insight into the potential depth of the burn and healing capacity. The patient's hand dominance, occupation, and prior hand injuries should also be ascertained.</p><p>The focus of the physical examination is to estimate the severity and depth of injury as well as the viability of the hand and digits. Adequate hand perfusion is present if the radial and ulnar pulses are palpable; Doppler assessment should be done if pulses are not palpable. Each digit should be evaluated separately for perfusion by Doppler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients at greatest risk for loss of perfusion are those who have full thickness burns, circumferential burns, or associated crush injuries and lacerations.</p><p>Signs of poor perfusion include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Capillary refill time &gt;2 seconds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cold hand to touch</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of Doppler signal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central core-to-extremity temperature difference greater than 7 degrees Celsius</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle compartment pressures of &gt;30 mmHg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen saturation &lt;90 percent or a 6 percent difference between a healthy site and the injured site, with caution as low readings may be due to vasoconstriction rather than compression</p><p/><p>Dressings should be applied to fingers individually. The thickness of the dressings should not interfere with range of motion and use of the hand. Splinting is reserved for patients who have deep burns and a clawed deformity or those who have a progressively diminished range of motion. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients are encouraged to use their injured hands to minimize swelling and loss of function and to elevate the hand when not engaging in activities.

Given the complex nature of the hand, referral to a designated burn center should be made for surgical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-minor-thermal-burns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of minor thermal burns&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurovascular compromise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurovascular compromise is one of the major complications of burns to the hand. It can result from formation of a circumferential eschar or from increased pressure in the muscle compartment due to large volumes of resuscitation fluid. Decompressive therapies include escharotomy, fasciotomy, and peripheral nerve release. There is insufficient evidence to support a single standard approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Escharotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Escharotomy restores perfusion to the hand by releasing the constricting eschar. In patients with signs of poor perfusion, immediate escharotomy should be performed to salvage the hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>]. By the time radial and ulnar pulses disappear, tissue ischemia is well advanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For compartment pressures between 25 and 30 mmHg, either escharotomy or close and continued monitoring for signs of vascular compromise is a reasonable approach.</p><p>Expert opinion and experience guide decision making in these difficult situations. Continued monitoring, reassessment, and transfer to a burn center if possible will minimize the risk of serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Additional indications for escharotomies resulting from a full thickness burn include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance to passive straightening of fingers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand tense to palpation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumferential burn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p/><p>An escharotomy can be performed laterally at the forearm or wrist (conventional) when proximal injury is influencing the blood supply to the hand alone, or with digital escharotomy. The incision is made with a knife or coagulation electrocautery, incising the full thickness of the eschar into the subcutaneous tissue but leaving the fascia intact. A randomized trial comparing the two approaches in 26 circumferentially burned hands found that conventional escharotomy was associated with a threefold higher risk of developing necrotic phalanges than conventional therapy plus digital escharotomy (20.8 versus 7.1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although the digital escharotomy incisions healed without complications in this study, recognized complications of this procedure include nerve damage, tendon injury, and blood loss. </p><p>It is not our practice to perform digital escharotomies, as damage to key superficial structures likely outweighs the potential benefit. If a digital escharotomy is performed, the incision should be performed on the ulnar side of the digit. An escharotomy performed on the radial side of the digit may result in damage to the vascular nerve bundle leading to impaired sensitivity and function.</p><p>After escharotomy, the hand is clinically evaluated for restoration or failure of perfusion. If perfusion is not restored, then fasciotomy is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Fasciotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fasciotomy releases the tension or pressure in a muscle compartment by incising the fascia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

When performed, fasciotomies should be optimally placed to preserve tissue that may needed for later wound coverage. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Surgical procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Peripheral nerve release</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decompressive therapies are performed for signs and symptoms of median, ulnar, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radial nerve compression. Symptoms include a loss of sensation, loss of motor function, and paresthesias. Carpal tunnel release may be required if median nerve symptoms, characterized by decreased sensation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diminished grip or pinch, develop in a previously normally functioning hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgery-for-carpal-tunnel-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of ulnar nerve compression, characterized by decreased sensation in the ulnar nerve sensory distribution and diminished flexion of the wrist and digits, can be alleviated with a release of Guyon's canal. Symptoms of radial nerve compression include diminished extension and abduction of the wrist and digits, and paresthesias. Incising the deep interosseous fascia on the dorsal hand releases the entrapped nerve. Sensory symptoms may be difficult to assess in the burn victim, and the focus should be on the motor function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Amputation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases of severe vascular, tendon, bone, or joint damage, it may not be possible to salvage the hand. If there is a question regarding viability, amputation may be delayed or tissue flap coverage attempted. If a flap is performed and fails, delayed amputation is an option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins#H25050215\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of burn reconstruction: Extremities and regional nodal basins&quot;, section on 'Amputated digits'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of the tissue loss depends on the depth and type of the burn. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of burn injury&quot;</a>.) Wound coverage with either skin grafts, tissue flaps, or dermal matrices is an important component of the process of regaining function of the hand. Skin grafts or tissue flap coverage are generally used in deep second-degree or full thickness burns approximately 14 to 21 days after burn injury. In comparison, superficial burns are most likely to heal with local nonoperative wound care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Excision and skin grafting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional surgical approach to burns capable of healing within two to three weeks, such as superficial and intermediate partial thickness burns, is to manage the burn with nonoperative local wound care including debridement and dressing changes, and aggressive range of motion exercises. A prospective study of 164 burned hands found that hands with superficial burns responded equally well to operative or nonoperative management when evaluated for preservation of hand function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Deep second-degree or full thickness burns are not likely to heal within two to three weeks with nonoperative treatment. These burns are managed with excision of the necrotic tissue and grafting for coverage of the burn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review of 116 burned hands showed that early excision and grafting within the first four to six days post-burn significantly reduced the risk of functionally debilitating scars compared with delayed grafting (7.7 versus 36.8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective trial of patients with deep second- and third-degree burns of the hands treated by early (2 to 12 days post-burn) excision and grafting (n = 25) demonstrated no significant difference in hand function, deformities, scarring, and patient satisfaction compared with burned hands treated with initial conservative management of topical antibiotics and dressings and delayed excision and grafting (4 to 8 weeks post-burn, n = 25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p/><p>A caveat to comparing these studies is that there is no consensus on the definition of what constitutes early versus late surgical excision and grafting of deep hand burns. In the absence of high-quality prospective data, early excision and skin grafting within the first four to six days appears to be the treatment of choice if it is clear that the burn will not heal within two to three weeks. </p><p>Burns must be reevaluated frequently as the burn process is dynamic and it is difficult to distinguish partial from full thickness burns. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Surgical procedures'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Burns of the palms warrant special consideration. The skin of the palm is very thick, with excellent healing potential. Hence, palm burns will generally heal without grafting, and early excision should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21</a>]. Aggressive physical therapy must be undertaken to prevent palmar contractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Tissue flaps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dorsal skin of the hand is relatively thin, and, therefore, deep burns often injure or expose underlying structures such as tendons, joints, and bone. Debridement of deep burns may also result in exposure of these structures. These wounds, in the absence of periosteum or paratenon, are not amenable to coverage with skin grafts, and tissue flaps are required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The forearm fascial flap, with radial artery preservation or modifications of the blood supply, provides an excellent option for vascularized coverage and is the procedure of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. These versatile and reliable flaps include skin, subcutaneous tissue, the underlying fascia, and septocutaneous perforating branches of the radial or ulnar artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The success rate for overall viability is excellent. Small series of case reports identify partial or superficial flap loss requiring a skin graft in approximately 15 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Long-term results reveal good flap durability and elasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>With extensive burns, the forearm tissue may not be available, and distant flaps, either pedicled or free flaps, may be required for tissue coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/22,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28</a>]. In a retrospective review of 1339 burn injuries over five years, only six patients (0.4 percent) required a distant pedicle flap for coverage of the burned hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Five of these six patients had complete healing of the wound, and one had partial loss of the flap. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Surgical procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hand has 10 osteofascial compartments: four dorsal interossei, three volar interossei, the thenar muscles, the hypothenar muscles, and the adductor pollicis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74598 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The radial and ulnar arteries and the superficial and deep palmar arches provide the blood supply to the hand. In many patients, the hand is viable with only one artery intact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74598 \">figure 1</a>). The median, radial, and ulnar nerves provide innervation to the hand. These nerves give rise to the digital nerves that run laterally in each digit along with the digital artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52343 \">figure 2</a>). The hand also has unique properties in terms of skin structure. The dorsal hand has thin, pliable skin that allows for flexion. The palmar surface, however, is thick and tightly held to underlying structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the exception of escharotomy, all of the following procedures should be performed in the operating room under a general or regional anesthetic. Emergent escharotomy may be performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit (ICU) with appropriate pain and anxiolytic medication.</p><p>Intraoperative monitoring is guided by the overall extent of the burn injury. While no specific monitoring is required for hand burns, patients may have extensive and severe burns that require aggressive resuscitation and management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypermetabolic-response-to-severe-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypermetabolic response to severe burn injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decompressive therapies include an escharotomy, fasciotomy, and release of peripheral nerve entrapment.

The subcutaneous tissue should not be incised. The procedure is not painful when performed correctly. The eschar itself is insensate, so severe pain during an escharotomy should prompt immediate reevaluation of the appropriateness of the procedure or the technique.</p><p>Axial incisions are made at both the radial and the ulnar aspects of the wrist. Longitudinal escharotomies of the digits are performed on the midlateral side of the digit; however, as discussed above, their use is controversial because of potential injury to digital nerves and arteries; thus, clinical judgment is warranted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64145 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Perfusion to the digits and hand should be reassessed immediately after escharotomy. If circulation remains compromised, additional escharotomies are performed over the intermetacarpal spaces, without exposing the tendons. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Secondary management'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Fasciotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fasciotomy is performed if an escharotomy fails to restore perfusion. Carpal tunnel release is an example of a fasciotomy to release an entrapped medial nerve. As the constricting fascia is released, viability of muscle is assessed and debridement of necrotic tissue is performed. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Secondary management'</a> above.)</p><p>A complete hand fasciotomy consists of four incisions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radial side of the thumb, which releases the thenar compartment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dorsal incision over the index finger metacarpal, which releases the first and second dorsal interossei, volar interossei, and adductor pollicis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dorsal incision over the fourth (ring) finger metacarpal, which releases the third and fourth interossei and volar interossei.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulnar side of the small finger, which releases the hypothenar muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Excision and grafting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because excision proceeds tangentially across blood vessels, bleeding can be significant, and a tourniquet should be used to minimize blood loss. Excision may be performed with a Goulian knife, though this is difficult in certain areas such as web spaces. A hydrosurgery system (eg, Versajet) is useful in these areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56945\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56945 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Underlying structures such as tendons, joints, or bones should not be exposed. If small areas are exposed, surrounding periosteum should be sutured in place for coverage. </p><p>Adequate hemostasis is essential to preventing hematoma formation and graft loss. Once the excision is complete, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (1:10,000)-soaked nonadhesive dressings and epinephrine-soaked laparotomy pads are applied prior to deflating the tourniquet and left in place for 10 minutes to achieve hemostasis. Tissue viability is confirmed by releasing the tourniquet to observe bleeding.</p><p>Skin grafting of the hand is performed using split-thickness skin grafts from unburned donor sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As hand function and aesthetic outcome are critical in hand burn management, sheet grafts are preferable to meshed grafts and can be harvested from the back, scalp, or thigh. Skin is harvested at a thickness of 0.012 inches for the dorsal hand and digits for adults and 0.008 inches for children. For the palm, we utilize full-thickness grafts (particularly in children) when a donor site is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and if not, we use thick split-thickness grafts of 0.016 to 0.018 inches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/21,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,34,35</a>]. Management of the donor site is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-flaps-for-soft-tissue-reconstruction#H2562820893\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction&quot;, section on 'Management of donor sites'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes#H2972619160\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin grafting and skin substitutes&quot;, section on 'Donor site dressings and care'</a>.)</p><p>To prevent shearing of the grafts, the hand is grafted and the position maintained in the splint (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Positioning'</a> below). Grafts are affixed with absorbable suture or specialized fixation tape, using fibrin glue to minimize the number of sutures required. Following placement, the grafted hand is dressed first with a nonadherent dressing and then with a thick gauze wrap, followed by a custom fabricated splint. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermal regeneration templates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following excision of the burn, the wound bed is evaluated to determine if it is suitable for a skin graft. The wound bed should be assessed for thoroughness of the debridement; vascularity; and exposure of bone, joint, or tendon. A cadaver allograft can be used as temporary wound cover as a test of the viability of the wound bed. Adherence of the allograft to the wound bed within five days of coverage indicates that the wound is ready for a skin graft. If the allograft is not adherent to the base, then the wound will not heal with a skin graft.</p><p>Several dermal regeneration templates (dermal substitutes) are available to use as an adjunct. These substitutes will not create a viable wound bed and should not be used if viability is questioned. Dermal regeneration templates are not substitutes for flap coverage in instances of extensive tendon or bone exposure. Use of dermal substitutes also allows for coverage by thinner skin grafts.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Integra &ndash; Integra is a bilayer of bovine tendon collagen and glycosaminoglycan with silicon &quot;epidermis.&quot; After excision, Integra is placed over the wound bed and allowed to incorporate for approximately two weeks. In a second procedure, the outer silicone layer is removed, and a thin (0.006&quot;) split-thickness skin graft is placed over the &quot;neo-dermis.&quot; In one study, Integra was applied to 216 clean and surgically excised burn wounds in 13 centers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Two to three weeks later, the dermal layer regenerated and was subsequently covered with a thin epidermal skin graft. The median take rate of the Integra was 95 percent, and the median take rate of the skin graft was 98 percent. The hand is mobilized in the interim between surgical procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AlloDerm &ndash; AlloDerm is lyophilized human dermis with the cellular components removed. AlloDerm is placed over excised wounds, and the wound is allowed to granulate for approximately two weeks. The AlloDerm is then removed and split thickness skin grafts are placed. There are small case series describing the use of AlloDerm for burn wound management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Matriderm &ndash; Matriderm is a three-dimensional collagen and elastin matrix derived from bovine tendon and ligament. A small case series using Matriderm as a one-stage dermal replacement in severe hand burns revealed an overall take rate of 97 percent, excellent pliability of the grafted area, and full range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue flaps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposed tendon or bone is best treated by coverage with a tissue flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Skin grafts should not be used as coverage of these structures.</p><p>The following is a brief description of commonly used flaps.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radial forearm fasciocutaneous flap or fascial flap &ndash; Radial forearm fasciocutaneous flaps or fascial flaps are used as coverage of exposed tendons, bones, or joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80774\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80774 \">picture 3</a>). A Doppler ultrasound, rather than the Allen test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], is performed to ensure adequate blood flow to the hand through the palmar arch as these flaps are based on the radial artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A skin graft is required either for the donor site if a fasciocutaneous flap is used or for the flap if fascia only is used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distally based posterior interosseous flap (DBPIF) &ndash; The posterior interosseous flap is a fasciocutaneous flap harvested from the dorsal aspect of the forearm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The principle advantage of this flap is that neither of the major vessels perfusing the hand is disrupted. This is especially important if either the radial or the ulnar artery has already been injured. In such cases, DBPIF remains an option for skin coverage. The most common variation in the anatomy of these vessels is absence or hypoplasia; therefore, a small incision should be made to explore the vessels prior to flap elevation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal and groin flaps (distant pedicled flaps) &ndash; A pedicled flap is tissue that is transposed to a recipient site while still attached at the base to the donor site. The pedicle serves as a conduit for blood supply. The abdomen or groin pedicled flaps are options for skin coverage when local flaps are not feasible due to the extent of injury to the extremity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81818 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The transfer of tissue as a pedicled flap is a two-step procedure that includes creating the flap and covering the burn, then allowing time for vascularization of the wound and subsequent division from the base of the pedicled flap. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>As the first stage of the procedure, the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia are raised on a pedicle from the groin or abdomen and secured to the burned hand. The hand is retained in the in-situ position on the abdomen or groin for two to three weeks prior to flap division. Indocyanine-green near-infrared fluorescence angiography is used to assess flap viability, if needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At the second stage of the procedure, the flap is either divided completely from the donor site or a Crane procedure is performed in which only the fascia is transferred and the skin and subcutaneous tissue are resutured to the donor site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This approach requires grafting of the fascia on the hand but provides a viable thin and supple coverage as a base for an autograft.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free tissue transfer &ndash; Free tissue transfer, or free flaps, is the transfer of tissue from one location to another, along with its blood supply, and detached from the primary location. Free flaps provide a single-step approach to hand coverage in cases where there are no local tissue coverage options. Fascial flaps from the contralateral radial forearm fascia, temporoparietal fascia, dorsalis pedis fascia, anterolateral thigh, and muscle flaps from the serratus anterior, rectus abdominis, and gracilis are used as donor sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/28,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Biobrane glove</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biobrane is a bilaminate, semipermeable silicone membrane bound to a layer of nylon with porcine collagen. It is an alternative to conventional dressing changes for superficial partial thickness burns but cannot be used to treat deeper burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Biobrane is available as a glove for burned hands and is applied to clean wounds that present within 24 hours of injury.</p><p>Successful use of this modality requires a clean wound bed that is obtained often with use of a regional or general anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The glove is applied to the wound bed and secured with adhesive tape. For children, sheets of Biobrane can be tailored to fit smaller hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The glove can be removed once epithelialization occurs. Biobrane has been shown to reduce pain levels, healing times, and hospital stays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Vacuum-assisted closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) devices are topical negative pressure systems used to promote healing in acute and chronic wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/50-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-57</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;</a>). The VAC also can serve as a bolster for grafts.</p><p>Data on the efficacy of this VAC devices for the care of burns of the hand are promising but limited:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective trial compared use of the VAC negative pressure system with a standard bolster dressing over two weeks in 22 adult patients with skin-grafted burn wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Compared with the standard bolster group, 75 percent of wounds treated with VAC had a greater than or equivalent degree of reepithelialization, and 85 percent had a better than or equivalent graft quality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective multicenter trial evaluated VAC with conventional conservative management in 11 patients with bilateral hand burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The patients served as their own controls. The hand treated with the VAC device had less connective tissue edema, improved microcirculation by dynamic laser-fluorescence videography, and faster wound healing for both superficial and deep burns.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following placement of the grafts, the operative site is dressed with a nonadherent dressing, thick gauze wrap, and a custom fabricated splint. Dressings are removed on postoperative day 1 for inspection of the wound for a hematoma or seroma. If present, a small incision is used to incise the graft over the fluid collection. Daily inspection continues until there are no further fluid collections. The hand remains in dressings and immobilized until day 5, at which time range of motion exercises are started [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is our practice to begin physical therapy within 24 hours after injury regardless of the extent of the burn. Initially, the focus is on range of motion (ROM) and reduction of edema. Pain medications are provided but should not impede efforts at physical therapy. If the patient cannot actively participate in therapy, passive ROM should be performed. Throughout hospitalization, the patient is educated and directed toward independence with physical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Edema management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevation of the hand is one primary method of edema prevention. Hand exercises can activate muscle pumping within the hand and help reduce edema. In some cases, external pressure through self-adhesive wraps or bandages may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splinting is used when ROM is limited and contracture of the hand is likely to occur. The hand should be immobilized with wrist extension, metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) flexion, proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) and distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) extension, and thumb palmar abduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The first web space must be maintained. In cases of palmar burns, a pan-extension splint is used. Patients are instructed to continue ROM exercises, even with a splinting program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are not discharged until they are self-sufficient with wound care and physical therapy routines, including application of splints, if needed. Outpatient regimens may vary but remain multidisciplinary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scarring and contracture with loss of hand function remain serious problems, even with aggressive acute burn care. Split-thickness skin grafts contract from 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Even with early grafting, debilitating contractures occur in 7.7 percent of burned hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a review of 562 patients with hand burns, 15 percent required reconstructive surgery during a 10-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Scarring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pressure application is the mainstay of early scar management. In the early phase when shear forces from gloves cannot be tolerated on fragile skin grafts, self-adhesive bandages are used. As healing progresses, prefabricated pressure gloves are used, followed by custom-made pressure garments if needed. Inserts are used to ensure pressure is applied to appropriate areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The time for scar tissue to mature is 12 to 24 months. Therefore, surgical correction should generally be deferred until 12 months post-injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Contracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four main types of hand contracture that occur following burn injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50506\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50506 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contracture of the digits</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palmar contracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dorsal hand contracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Web space contractures</p><p/><p>Contractures affecting the deep structures are surgically released, and grafts or flaps cover the defects. Prior to considering procedures for contracture release, patient compliance with a physical therapy regimen is essential. If patients do not participate, the endeavor is doomed to failure. Secondary surgery, in the form of contracture release, is not a substitute for an aggressive physical therapy regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/10,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,59</a>].</p><p>Prior to the reconstruction operation, the functional deficit, the structure causing the problem, and available options for tissue coverage of the defect are addressed. The discussion with the patient focuses on reasonable expectations and outcome. The final portion of the operative planning includes timing of procedures. If both hands require reconstruction, it is more practical for the patient to operate on one hand at a time. In addition, if one correction will require aggressive use of the digits, it should not be performed at the same time as a procedure requiring prolonged immobilization. </p><p>Operative procedures for specific complications of burns to the hands and secondary reconstruction techniques are described in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins#H17954407\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of burn reconstruction: Extremities and regional nodal basins&quot;, section on 'Hand'</a>). Common techniques used in the management of burn hand deformities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Z-Plasty &ndash; Z-plasty provides a method of scar lengthening and is particularly well suited for isolated scar bands and web space contractures where there is not a significant skin deficit. For large areas, multiple Z-plasty can be performed to lengthen the scar. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=z-plasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Z-plasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>V-Y plasty &ndash; This technique can be used to lengthen a scar or close a small defect. It is designed in line with the contracture in the shape of a &quot;V.&quot; The &quot;V&quot; is then advanced and closed to form a &quot;Y.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Y-V plasty &ndash; Y-V plasties also provide a method of scar lengthening and are particularly useful for long linear scars. Y-V plasties do not require wide flap undermining as in the case of Z-plasties, since the flaps are advancement flaps and not transposition flaps. This is of particular importance when the flaps include scar tissue, since undermining of the Z-limbs in these situations may result in flap tip necrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Full-thickness skin grafts &ndash; In cases of skin deficiency, Z-, V-Y, and Y-V plasties insufficiently address the scar defect. Skin grafts or flaps are needed in these cases. Digit and palm flexion contracture releases should be performed sharply under tourniquet control. Templates of the resulting defects should be obtained, and full-thickness skin grafts should be used to close these defects. In the case of digit contractures, temporary fixation of the digits (three to four weeks) with Kirschner wires can be used to maintain adequate digit positioning.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of a hand results in an overall 57 percent loss of independent function; hence, aggressive measures to preserve function are a key component of burn management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. A retrospective review of 1047 acutely burned hands (659 patients) described a return to normal function in 97 percent of patients with superficial burns and 81 percent with deep dermal or full thickness burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Only 9 percent of patients with burns involving bone or joint capsules regained normal function, but 90 percent were able to perform activities of daily living independently.</p><p>The best measures to assess hand function and outcomes have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-operative-management-of-hand-burns/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. While it is possible to take many objective measures of hand movement, it can be difficult to correlate these with function, patient impairment, or quality of life.
