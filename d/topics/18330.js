This is an uncommon condition that is found mainly in adult women. The possibility of this diagnosis is often overlooked, even in women with presenting symptoms or findings (eg, urinary incontinence, dysuria, dyspareunia, vaginal mass). Delayed or missed diagnosis of this condition can lead to chronic morbidity including urethral calculus formation, chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) or, rarely, malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of urethral diverticula in women are reviewed here. Diagnosis and management of other etiologies of urinary incontinence or dyspareunia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the woman with sexual pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true prevalence of urethral diverticula is difficult to estimate, given the difficulty of accurate and timely diagnosis. The reported prevalence of urethral diverticula in adult females from studies of autopsy specimens or urethrography series ranges from 1 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A population-based study estimated the incidence to be less than 20 per 1,000,000 (&lt;0.02 percent) per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Urethral diverticula have rarely been reported in men or in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>Urethral diverticula typically present between the ages of 20 and 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. </p><p>Risk factors for a urethral diverticulum include female gender, pelvic trauma, and periurethral procedures, but there are no data to quantify these risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. It appears that black women are three-fold more likely than white women to have a urethral diverticulum, based upon data from hospital admissions and surgical procedures related to this diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The female urethra is a tubular structure 2.5 to 4 cm in length and approximately 0.6 cm in diameter that runs from the bladder to the urethral meatus in the anterior aspect of the vulvar vestibule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72614 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Along its path, it passes from the retropubic space and perforates the perineal membrane. </p><p>The periurethral glands are located medially and posterolaterally along the distal two-thirds of the urethra and drain into the distal third of the urethra. The periurethral glands secrete mucin that acts as sealant and contributes to urinary continence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Skene glands are periurethral glands found on either side of the urethra and are the female homologues of the prostate in males, since they arise from the urogenital sinus. </p><p>The proximal third of the urethra is lined by transitional epithelium and the distal two-thirds by squamous epithelium. The type of epithelial cells lining a diverticulum is usually identical to the epithelium of the urethra in the area of the diverticulum. Histologic changes commonly found within urethral diverticula include squamous metaplasia, adenomatous metaplasia, cystitis cystica, and cystitis glandularis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. </p><p>The morphology of diverticula is heterogeneous. Most urethral diverticula occur in the middle or distal portion of the posterior aspect of the urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Diverticula range in size from 0.3 to 5.0 cm in diameter. They may be unilocular or multilocular. More than one diverticulum may be present. The neck that connects the diverticulum to the urethral lumen may be closed, very narrow, or wide. </p><p>Diverticula are classified as simple or complex. Complex diverticula include multiple diverticula, those involving the urethral sphincter or bladder neck, horseshoe-shaped and saddle diverticula (diverticular sac that partially or circumferentially surrounds the urethra) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urethral diverticula are thought to be acquired rather than congenital in nearly all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]; they are rarely found in neonates. The pathogenesis is not clearly understood. </p><p>The most widely proposed theory is that a urethral diverticulum develops as a result of repeated infection of the periurethral glands, leading to obstruction and enlargement of the <span class=\"nowrap\">glands/ducts</span> and formation of a suburethral abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Eventually the abscess ruptures into the urethral lumen, creating a communication between the lumen and the abscess cavity. Evidence of chronic inflammation is supported by histopathology studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Chronic inflammation results in marked fibrosis within and surrounding the diverticulum, often with accompanying adherence to the neighboring structures. </p><p>Other possible etiologies include trauma, which may derive from any type of lower genital tract trauma, including vaginal, bladder, or urethral surgery or vaginal delivery. Diverticula have been reported as a rare complication following a midurethral sling procedure or after transurethral collagen injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Although trauma associated with vaginal delivery has been postulated as an etiology, the disorder often occurs in nulliparous women. As an example, one series reported that 30 percent of 121 urethral diverticula occurred in nulliparous women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a urethral diverticulum may present with postvoid dribbling of urine and an anterior vaginal wall mass, particularly a tender mass. In addition, the presentation may include dysuria or dyspareunia. </p><p>A high index of suspicion is essential for making the diagnosis. This is because urethral diverticulum is an uncommon condition and many of the presenting symptoms (urinary incontinence, dysuria, dyspareunia) are more frequently associated with other etiologies. In addition, some women may have both a urethral diverticulum and another more common condition; for example, stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common condition in women, and the symptoms of this condition may obscure the concurrent presence of postvoid dribbling. As a result, diagnosis is often delayed. In one series of 46 patients with urethral diverticula, the mean time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 5.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H708897\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presenting symptoms of a urethral diverticulum are highly variable. Patients may also be asymptomatic. </p><p>The classic presentation includes the following triad of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postvoid dribbling (4 to 31 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysuria (9 to 55 percent) &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspareunia (6 to 24 percent)</p><p/><p>Other potential presenting complaints include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/2,12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,16,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) (9 to 61 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary frequency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urgency (6 to 38 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematuria (2 to 13 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody urethral discharge (2 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary incontinence (29 to 39 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary retention (2 to 19 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic or urethral pain (6 to 48 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal mass (6 to 50 percent) </p><p/><p>Recurrent UTI may be related to urinary stasis in the diverticulum. Urinary incontinence may be secondary to periurethral support defects, compromise of the urethral sphincter, or drainage of urine from the diverticulum. Although symptoms are variable, a review of 54 women reported urinary tract infections, stress incontinence, dyspareunia, and vaginal mass as the most common presenting symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The classic triad of dribbling, dysuria, and dyspareunia is rarely seen in an individual patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A palpable vaginal mass is present in up to half of the patients with a urethral diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Tenderness is often present with palpation of the mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2637002\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF WOMEN WITH A SUSPECTED URETHRAL DIVERTICULUM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2637119\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical history should include questions regarding symptoms associated with a urethral diverticulum. (See <a href=\"#H708897\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p>For women with urinary incontinence or postvoid dribbling, a voiding diary is often helpful to characterize the pattern and amount of incontinence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69130 \">figure 2</a>). Bloody urethral discharge must be differentiated from vaginal or anal bleeding. One approach to confirming the source of bleeding is to ask the patient to dab each area with toilet paper after an episode and note if blood is present. </p><p>Women who report dyspareunia should be asked whether the pain is localized to the anterior vaginal wall.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2637111\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urethral diverticula are usually located at the middle or distal portion on the posterior aspect of the urethra. An anterior vaginal wall mass is found on physical examination in many, but not all, patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The finding of suburethral mass on examination does not confirm the diagnosis of a urethral diverticulum. Further evaluation is required to exclude other conditions or associated findings. (See <a href=\"#H707559\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>To best visualize the anterior vaginal wall during the pelvic examination, the anterior vaginal wall is first visualized by using a half speculum to retract the posterior vaginal wall. The anterior vaginal wall is inspected while the patient rests and then does a Valsalva maneuver. </p><p>The anterior wall and the course of the urethra are then palpated to assess for findings that suggest the presence of a diverticulum (a suburethral mass, fullness, or tenderness). An attempt should also be made to express urine or purulent or bloody discharge from the suburethral mass. Palpating the suspicious area with and then without a bladder catheter in the urethral lumen may help to distinguish a true urethral mass from conditions that may give the appearance of a mass, such as redundant vaginal epithelium associated with anterior vaginal wall prolapse. </p><p>Most urethral diverticula are soft. A firm mass may represent malignancy or a calculus, and warrants further evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H21970996\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation to exclude associated conditions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8714148\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with symptoms of dysuria, urinary urgency or frequency, or hematuria, a urinalysis should be performed. If leukocytes are present, a urine culture should be sent to exclude infection. Women with hematuria should be evaluated for other conditions, including urinary tract malignancy, as appropriate. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H707664\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies and endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data to guide the choice of diagnostic study for urethral diverticula. We suggest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the first line imaging study for patients with a suburethral mass and symptoms consistent with a urethral diverticulum. MRI appears to have the best diagnostic performance and can also help to exclude clinically important features of a diverticulum (ie, solid mass suggestive of malignancy, calculi) or other periurethral conditions. (See <a href=\"#H21970996\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation to exclude associated conditions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H707559\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>It is reasonable to use ultrasound as the first line study if MRI is not feasible due to expense or lack of available expertise in the interpretation of an MRI regarding this condition. However, ultrasound findings may be nonspecific and require further evaluation with MRI. &#160;</p><p>Urethroscopy is performed only as an adjunct to MRI or ultrasound to provide information regarding the anatomic relationship of the diverticular ostium to the urethra. </p><p>Traditionally, contrast-enhanced radiography (eg, voiding cystourethrography, retrograde double-balloon positive pressure urethrography) were used to evaluate women for urethral diverticulum. However, these procedures are invasive and technically difficult and the contrast-dependent studies are only able to visualize diverticula that are patent enough to allow filling with contrast material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Thus, these studies have largely been replaced by MRI or ultrasound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI appears to be effective for the diagnosis of urethral diverticulum, but this is based upon limited data from small observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>]. No studies have compared MRI with other imaging modalities for evaluation of this condition.</p><p>Case series with 40 to 60 women with a suspected diverticulum who were evaluated with MRI have reported that the sensitivity for the diagnosis of urethral diverticulum was 86 to 100 percent and the specificity was 95 to 100 percent; the reference standard was either surgical findings or a second imaging study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The sensitivity of MRI in evaluating urethral masses may also depend upon the expertise of the radiologist reading the study.</p><p>Advantages of MRI compared with ultrasound or urethroscopy are that it allows better visualization of diverticula that are small or noncommunicating and provides multiplanar resolution lending superior tissue resolution and allowing for differentiation between normal anatomical variants, soft tissue masses, and urethral pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82937%7EOBGYN%2F82938%7EOBGYN%2F82939\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82937 graphicRef82938 graphicRef82939 \">image 1A-C</a>). Although in experienced hands, similar imaging information can also be obtained by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In terms of technique, most reports have found that use of an endoluminal coil (endourethral, endovaginal, or endorectal) is a useful technique for evaluating the urethra and periurethral region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/21,22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,26</a>]. Detection of multiple diverticula is optimally achieved using MRI with slices from just above the bladder neck to the distal urethra. </p><p>MRI is potentially better able than ultrasound to detect findings such as a solid mass within the diverticulum (which may signify malignancy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, malignancy should be suspected if the wall of the diverticulum is focally thickened or irregular. Alternatively, infection and inflammation can lead to a more diffusely thick-walled and hyperemic appearance. Use of contrast will show contrast enhancement in the lesion. (See <a href=\"#H21971004\" class=\"local\">'Malignant or benign neoplasms'</a> below.)</p><p>However, MRI may miss some diagnoses of malignancy. As an example, in one study with 41 women, 2 patients were found to have malignancy within the wall of a urethral diverticulum at time of surgery, but no findings suggestive of this were detected with preoperative MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>On MRI, the appearance of calculi is dependent upon the imaging sequence utilized. On T2-weighted imaging, a calculus appears with low signal intensity. If the calculus is surrounded by fluid within a diverticulum, the fluid will be bright on T2 weighted imaging, and the stone will be seen as a filling defect. (See <a href=\"#H21971020\" class=\"local\">'Calculi'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic performance of ultrasound for evaluation of urethral diverticulum has been evaluated only in small case series. A study comparing ultrasound (transvaginal, transperineal, or endourethral) to voiding cystourethrography found that both studies were able to diagnose 13 of 15 urethral diverticula, but ultrasound was also able to diagnose periurethral cysts and leiomyomas not detected by voiding cystourethrography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In another study, 10 cases of urethral diverticulum diagnosed with transvaginal ultrasound were confirmed with surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>When ultrasound is used to assess for a urethral diverticulum, transvaginal ultrasonography is the preferred technique. Transabdominal, transrectal, or transperineal approaches provide images of lower quality than transvaginal. The transurethral approach has been reported, but more data are needed. The three-dimensional ultrasound technique is gaining popularity due to lower cost and patient comfort compared with MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/19,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,31</a>]. </p><p>In terms of technique for transvaginal ultrasound, the probe is partially inserted into the vagina, and imaging is directed to the expected location and course of the urethra. A high frequency probe (&gt;7 MHz) is used for real-time visualization of the diverticular wall and its contents, and to measure the overall size and circumference of the urethral mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82806\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82806 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>]. The patient should have a partially full bladder during the examination for anatomical orientation. Color Doppler may be used if there is a finding of a solid mass suggestive of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>On ultrasound, a finding of a soft tissue mass within a diverticulum with flow on Doppler is suggestive of malignancy. An irregular or thickened diverticular wall may be noted. As discussed above, wall thickening may also result from infection or inflammation. Color Doppler will show flow to the region of suspicion. (See <a href=\"#H21971004\" class=\"local\">'Malignant or benign neoplasms'</a> below.)</p><p>Calculi are seen on ultrasound as strongly echogenic masses with shadowing within the diverticulum. (See <a href=\"#H21971020\" class=\"local\">'Calculi'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2637536\"><span class=\"h3\">Urethroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urethroscopy may be used as an adjunct to MRI or ultrasound to provide information regarding the anatomic relationship of the diverticular ostium to the urethra. This information can be helpful during surgical treatment. This procedure permits visual examination of the urethral epithelium and urethrovesical junction and may be useful in diverticula with large ostia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54925\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54925 \">picture 1</a>). The limitations of this procedure are that it cannot visualize beyond the ostium of the diverticulum, does not provide information on the size or complexity of the diverticulum, causes patient discomfort, and is expensive if performed in an operating room setting. If urethroscopy is not performed as part of the preoperative evaluation, we recommend starting surgical treatment with urethroscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H707652\"><span class=\"h3\">Tests no longer recommended</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h4\">Voiding cystourethrography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This test is no longer recommended for routine evaluation of urethral diverticulum since it is uncomfortable for the patient, has limited diagnostic performance, and involves exposure to radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The sensitivity is low, approximately 65 percent, which may be attributable to inadequate filling of the diverticulum through a stenotic ostium. In addition, this study does not provide images of periurethral lesions that are necessary to exclude other conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">Retrograde positive pressure urethrography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This test is no longer recommended for routine evaluation of urethral diverticulum since it is uncomfortable for the patient, has limited diagnostic performance, and involves exposure to radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Similar to voiding cystourethrography, retrograde double-balloon positive pressure urethrography is not effective for detecting stenotic diverticula and also does not provide images of periurethral lesions to exclude other conditions. The test is performed by occluding each end of the urethra by a double balloon catheter. Contrast medium is then infused under pressure into an opening in the urethral portion of the catheter in order to distend any urethral communication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H707641\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of urethral diverticulum is made by urethral and periurethral imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in women with characteristic symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a periurethral mass.

The most common condition in the differential diagnosis is anterior vaginal wall prolapse, which typically involves the entire anterior vaginal wall on examination, while a urethral diverticulum is generally palpable as a discrete mass.

A literature review reported that postoperative SUI develops in 1.7 to 12.5 percent of women following surgical treatment of a diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Some surgeons advocate performing a concomitant SUI procedure at the time of diverticular excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Other surgeons disagree with this approach, since many patients will not develop urinary incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, many patients with a diverticulum are young and anti-incontinence procedures are not typically performed in women who have not completed childbearing.

If there is extensive dissection and it is felt there may be voiding dysfunction even after 7 to 14 days, a suprapubic catheter may be preferable. The duration of catheterization depends upon the size of the urethral defect. </p><p>We perform a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) 14 days after surgery to evaluate the integrity of the repair. If a small amount of extravasation is seen, we continue bladder drainage and repeat the VCUG the following week.

(See <a href=\"#H707641\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of a periurethral mass includes vaginal wall inclusion cyst, Skene gland abscess, Gartner's duct cyst, ectopic ureterocele, periurethral fibrosis, urethrocele, vaginal leiomyoma, and urethral or vaginal neoplasm. (See <a href=\"#H707559\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conservative management of a urethral diverticulum is a reasonable option for women who have no bothersome symptoms and in whom there is no suspicion of malignancy or a diverticular calculus. (See <a href=\"#H326047\" class=\"local\">'Patients without bothersome symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with bothersome symptoms or a diverticular calculus, we suggest surgical treatment rather than conservative management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Surgery is indicated if a diverticular malignancy is suspected. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest transvaginal diverticulectomy rather than other surgical procedures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with a diverticulum that is distal to the urethral sphincter, a marsupialization procedure is a reasonable option. (See <a href=\"#H326272\" class=\"local\">'Patients with bothersome symptoms or suspected malignancy or calculi'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical treatment of a diverticulum may disrupt the continence zone of the urethra. The decision of whether to perform a concomitant continence procedure at the time of surgical treatment should be individualized. (See <a href=\"#H326642\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant incontinence procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical cure rates after diverticular excision are approximately 70 to 86 percent. The most common postoperative complications are recurrent diverticulum, urethrovaginal fistula, stress incontinence, urethral strictures, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). (See <a href=\"#H326793\" class=\"local\">'Outcome and complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urethral-diverticulum-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Foley CL, Greenwell TJ, Gardiner RA.
