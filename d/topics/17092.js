Acute hypercapnia is often not suspected, leading to delayed diagnosis. If left untreated, acute hypercapnic respiratory failure may become life-threatening resulting in respiratory arrest, seizures, coma, and death. </p><p>The approach to adult patients with suspected hypercapnia, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure are discussed in this topic. For the most part, this topic discusses the approach in patients who are spontaneously breathing, although many of the same principles can be applied to patients who are receiving invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support. The mechanisms, etiologies, and end-organ effects associated with hypercapnia are discussed more extensively separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H468094\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypercapnia is defined as an elevation in the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>). The carbon dioxide level in arterial blood is directly proportional to the rate of carbon dioxide (VCO<sub>2</sub>) production and inversely proportional to the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> elimination by the lung (alveolar ventilation). Alveolar ventilation (V<sub>A</sub>) is, in turn, determined by minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) and the ratio of dead space (V<sub>D</sub>) to tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) (V<sub>A</sub> = V<sub>E</sub> x [1 - V<sub>D</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/V<sub>T</sub>])</span>. Increased dead space and reduced minute ventilation are common causes of hypercapnia. In contrast, unless a patient has limited pulmonary reserve, increased CO<sub>2</sub> production rarely results in clinically important hypercapnia. Etiologies associated with hypercapnia are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F103091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103091 \">table 1</a>). Detailed discussion of the mechanisms and etiologies of hypercapnia is provided separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H468101\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SUSPECT ACUTE HYPERCAPNIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypercapnia should always be suspected in those who are at risk for hypoventilation (eg, sedatives) or increased physiologic dead space and limited pulmonary reserve (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation) who present with shortness of breath, a change in mental status, new hypoxemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypersomnolence.</p><p>The presenting features of acute hypercapnia are variable with no signs or symptoms that are sensitive or specific for the diagnosis. Patients can present with the manifestations of hypercapnia itself as well as with the manifestations associated with the underlying disorder, both of which are discussed in detail in the sections below. It is important to remember that tachypnea does not always equate to increased alveolar ventilation; patients with increased dead space and mechanical abnormalities of the respiratory system may have elevated respiratory rate and accessory muscle use, yet still be hypercapnic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H468120\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features of hypercapnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of hypercapnia are mostly neurologic and pulmonary, and vary depending upon the level and rate of CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation in arterial blood: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mild to moderate hypercapnia or hypercapnia that develops slowly may be anxious, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complain of mild dyspnea, daytime sluggishness, headaches, or hypersomnolence. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> or rapidly developing hypercapnia develop frank alterations in sensorium including delirium, paranoia, depression, and confusion, which progress to coma (CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis) as levels continue to rise. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe hypercapnia present with asterixis, myoclonus, and seizures as well as papilledema, and dilated superficial veins. </p><p/><p>Normal individuals do not exhibit a depressed level of consciousness until the PaCO<sub>2</sub> is greater than 75 to 80 mmHg (9.9 to 10.9 kPa), while patients with chronic hypercapnia may not develop symptoms until the PaCO<sub>2</sub> rises acutely to greater than 90 to 100 mmHg (11.9 to 13.3 kPa). The mechanisms that underlie the cerebral and cardiorespiratory effects of hypercapnia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia#H447565976\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms, causes, and effects of hypercapnia&quot;, section on 'Effects of hypercapnia'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H468246\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features of the underlying cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the wide range of etiologies for hypercapnia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F103091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103091 \">table 1</a>), the presenting features from the underlying disorder can be variable and frequently overlap. However, the presence of an underlying disorder or risk factor should increase the suspicion for hypercapnia and prompt arterial blood gas analysis. Clinicians should look for a history of common risk factors, including sedative <span class=\"nowrap\">use/abuse,</span> the signs and symptoms of chronic lung disease (eg, clubbing, hyperinflation, thoracic cage abnormalities, cyanosis from associated hypoxemia), and obvious central or peripheral neuromuscular disorders (eg, hemiplegia, obesity, snoring, neuromuscular weakness). A commonly missed presentation of acute hypercapnia is the postoperative <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/post</span> anesthetic patient who becomes hypoxemic. There is a tendency to treat hypoxemia by giving supplemental oxygen, which may worsen the hypercapnia, lead to more hypoxemia, and further increases in supplemental oxygen ultimately resulting in a vicious cycle and respiratory failure.</p><p>A thorough history and examination should be elicited to confirm or rule out the following common etiologies: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sedative use</strong> &ndash; Patients may exhibit a history of illicit or prescribed sedative use with drugs including narcotics and benzodiazepines, as well as anesthetic agents. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>COPD or other lung disorders</strong> &ndash; During an exacerbation or in response to oxygen administration, some patients with COPD (but not all) develop acute or acute-on-chronic hypercapnia. Similarly, patients with end-stage interstitial lung disease (ILD) may present with acute hypercapnia. The diagnosis of COPD or ILD may be known or may be evident by a long smoking history together with the typical clinical signs of COPD or ILD, which are discussed separately. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central, neuromuscular, and thoracic cage disorders</strong> &ndash; Similar to patients with COPD, patients with central, neuromuscular, and thoracic cage disorders may develop acute or acute-on-chronic hypercapnia during times of acute stress (eg, infection, dehydration, postoperative states).

However, when oxygen-associated hypercapnic respiratory failure is suspected and the peripheral oxygen saturation is in the high normal range (eg, &ge;95 percent), supplemental oxygen can be reduced to maintain peripheral saturation between 90 and 93 percent, while results from ABGs are pending. The administration of oxygen to patients with hypercapnia is discussed below. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventilatory support</strong> &ndash; Patients with severe respiratory distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> marked hemodynamic instability are usually intubated. Rapid sequence intubation, typically with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously; unless septic shock is suspected) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously), and a rapidly acting neuromuscular blocker (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rocuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rocuronium</a> 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously), is the preferred approach. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable, agents that worsen hypotension (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>) should be avoided. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure from upper airway obstruction, in whom an endotracheal tube cannot be placed, an emergent cricothyrotomy can be performed, the details of which are discussed separately. In those with mild to moderate distress with a known treatable cause for the upper airway obstruction, eg, laryngeal edema, initiation of supplemental oxygen via a mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox) may reduce turbulent flow and the work of breathing while treatment for the underlying problem is started. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with mild to moderate respiratory failure, particularly that due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or congestive heart failure exacerbation without severely impaired consciousness, noninvasive ventilation or bag-mask valve ventilation may stabilize the patient's condition and avert endotracheal intubation. The indications for and application of these therapies are discussed below. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravenous access</strong> &ndash; Peripheral venous access is sufficient for the <strong>initial</strong> management of acidosis-associated hypotension or shock with intravenous fluids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasopressors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intra-arterial access</strong> &ndash; Arterial access is not typically necessary unless the patient requires multiple arterial blood draws or arterial access is needed for an alternative reason (eg, hemodynamic monitoring). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1033772780\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial blood gas analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even a low clinical suspicion should prompt ABG analysis for the diagnosis of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure &#160; The identification of an elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide is diagnostic of hypercapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt; 45 mmHg). Once identified, hypercapnic respiratory failure should be classified as acute, acute-on-chronic, or chronic. Acute hypercapnia is always accompanied by a respiratory acidosis (pH &lt;7.35) that is appropriate for the degree of hypercapnia, whereas chronic hypercapnia is associated with a low-normal or near normal pH (assuming the patient has normal renal function and the ability to excrete acid by the kidney), and acute-on chronic hypercapnia lies in between these parameters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79833\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79833 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58687\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58687 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63315\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63315 \">figure 3</a>). &#160;</p><p>Due to greater accuracy, we prefer that ABG analysis be performed in patients with suspected hypercapnic respiratory failure rather than venous blood gas (VBG) analysis. Peripheral VBGs tend to have a slightly higher PaCO<sub>2</sub> and bicarbonate level, and a lower pH, but can be used if ABGs cannot be obtained <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if frequent samples are necessary to follow therapy. Detailed discussion on the use and interpretation of VBGs is provided separately. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1033774099\"><span class=\"h3\">Distinguishing acute and chronic hypercapnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute respiratory acidosis is present when an abrupt failure of ventilation occurs (eg, central nervous system disease or drug-induced respiratory depression, severe acute airways disease) or there is an acute process that worsens alveolar ventilation in a patient with limited pulmonary reserve (eg, pneumonia in a patient with COPD), whereas chronic respiratory acidosis develops over days to weeks such that bicarbonate rises as an indication that renal compensation, ie, secretion of acid, has occurred (usually more than three to five days; eg, COPD, chronic neuromuscular disorders). It is important to note that the metabolic compensation for respiratory acidosis is secretion of acid by the kidney; the elevated serum bicarbonate is a byproduct of acid secretion and does <strong>not</strong> play a role in buffering the respiratory acid. Serum bicarbonate is expected to rise slightly in an acute respiratory acidosis because of the resulting shift in the carbonic acid equilibrium.</p><p>When interpreting ABGs for hypercapnia, the following generally applies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis, the PaCO<sub>2</sub> is elevated above the upper limit of the reference range (ie, &gt;45 mmHg) with an accompanying acidemia (ie, pH &lt;7.35). In patients with pure acute respiratory acidosis and previous normocapnia, the measured level of hypercapnia and bicarbonate accurately predicts the pH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79833\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79833 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58687\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58687 \">figure 2</a>). In contrast, for patients who develop acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis, the measured pH will be higher than predicted. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In chronic compensated respiratory acidosis, the PaCO<sub>2</sub> is elevated above the upper limit of the normal reference range (ie, &gt;45 mmHg), but the pH is at the lower limit of normal or near-normal pH (eg, pH 7.33 to 7.35) secondary to renal compensation (secretion of acid from the distal tubule) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79833\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79833 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63315\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63315 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p/><p>Importantly, these rules are general principles and may be influenced by the presence of mixed and complex acid-base disturbances, such that we prefer a calculated approach to ABG interpretation. The assessment of acid-base disturbance as well as the interpretation of ABGs are discussed separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1033774105\"><span class=\"h3\">Determining the alveolar arterial gradient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoxemia frequently coexists with hypercapnic respiratory failure. When feasible, the alveolar-arterial gradient (PAO<sub>2</sub> &ndash; PaO<sub>2</sub> also known as the A-a gradient) should be calculated (from a room air blood gas) to distinguish hypercapnic respiratory failure due to global hypoventilation (extrapulmonary respiratory failure) from respiratory failure due to abnormal gas exchange from intrinsic lung disease. Since the range for a normal gradient increases with age, the gradient can be approximated by the equation A-a gradient = age x 0.3. An A-a gradient within the normal range in the setting of an elevated PaCO<sub>2</sub> is <strong>highly</strong> suggestive of global hypoventilation, whereas a widened gradient &gt;20 mmHg suggests that underlying lung disease may be contributing to the measured hypercapnia. Measuring the A-a gradient is more readily applied to patients in the chronic stable state and difficult to perform in patients with acute presentations because patients with acute hypercapnia often require the immediate application of supplemental oxygen, which precludes calculating a room air A-a gradient; however, if feasible, it is appropriate to draw an initial ABG prior to initiation of supplemental oxygen. An A-a gradient can also be reliably determined in situations where the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) is accurate (eg, mechanical ventilation).</p><p>As an example, global hypoventilation from sedatives is likely the primary cause of hypercapnic respiratory acidosis in an otherwise healthy young drug abuser with somnolence, a normal chest radiograph, positive toxicology screen, and a normal A-a gradient of &lt;20 mmHg. In contrast, abnormal gas exchange from increased dead space in patients with a COPD exacerbation or end stage interstitial lung disease (ILD) is typically associated with the usual clinical signs and symptoms of a COPD or ILD exacerbation and an ABG that reveals hypercapnia and a widened A-a gradient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435437724\"><span class=\"h2\">Bedside clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A brief history and examination should be performed at the bedside so that therapies targeted at a specific underlying cause can be administered quickly &#160; In addition to ABGs, a complete blood count, serum chemistries including bicarbonate and electrolytes, and a chest radiograph should be performed. Once the patient is stable, subsequent testing (eg, toxicology screen, thyroid function tests, chest or brain imaging) and therapies can then be appropriately tailored. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1183388852\"><span class=\"h3\">History and examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high clinical suspicion for the presence of hypercapnic respiratory failure is critical for diagnosis. An initial efficient and targeted history from prehospital or hospital providers, the patient, their relatives, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the medical record should provide ample information on a patient's risk for hypercapnia, as well as the potential etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F103091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103091 \">table 1</a>). For the detection of common etiologies, this may include a drug history, past history of chronic lung disease, sleep apnea, or a neuromuscular disorder, a smoking and travel history as well as a history of recent trauma. For patients on oxygen, recent changes in the flow settings should be assessed. Once patients are stable and the diagnosis of hypercapnic respiratory failure is made, a more detailed approach to the history should be undertaken with a specific etiology in mind. &#160;</p><p>Physical examination should be directed towards uncovering the cause of hypercapnia. The evaluation should include an assessment of sensorium, mucous membranes, asterixis, lungs, heart, thoracic cage, and abdomen, as well as skin and joints. A brief neurologic examination should also be performed to distinguish the many central and peripheral neurologic etiologies associated with the development of acute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic hypercapnia. </p><p>A more detailed discussion of the clinical presentation of the many causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure is provided above. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435437826\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common laboratory abnormalities that should be drawn that also provide clues to the presence of hypercapnia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> identify a potential etiology of hypercapnic respiratory failure include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum chemistries, bicarbonate, and electrolytes</strong> &ndash; An elevated bicarbonate level may suggest underlying chronic hypercapnia at baseline, although this feature is nonspecific as other etiologies (eg, volume contraction, diuretics) can increase the bicarbonate concentration. Similarly, arterial blood gases drawn on previous admissions or in the chronic stable state may identify the presence of normocapnia or chronic hypercapnia at baseline. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional abnormalities that may suggest a contributing etiology for hypercapnia include electrolyte disturbances, especially low phosphate and magnesium levels. Rarely does hypermagnesemia, hypokalemia, or hypercalcemia cause respiratory muscle weakness that is severe enough to result in hypercapnia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complete blood count</strong> &ndash; Chronic hypoxemia from underlying lung disease may be associated with polycythemia.

When spontaneous ventilations are present, an initial dose of 0.05 mg intravenously (IV) is an appropriate starting point, and the dose should be titrated upward every few minutes until the respiratory rate is 12 or greater. Apneic patients should receive higher initial doses of naloxone (0.2 to 1 mg). Patients in cardiorespiratory arrest following possible opioid overdose should be given a minimum of 2 mg of naloxone. The intravenous route is preferred with careful titration of the dose so as not to induce opiate withdrawal.

In adults, the recommended initial dose is 0.2 mg given IV over 30 seconds. Repeated doses of 0.2 mg, to a maximum dose of 1 mg, can be given until the desired effect is achieved. The biggest disadvantage of flumazenil is that it is short-acting. In the event of resedation after initial administration, the dosing regimen described here can be repeated, but no more than 3 mg of flumazenil should be given within any one hour.

Thus, vigilant clinical monitoring of vital signs and follow up blood gas analysis is necessary to identify those in whom NIV is successful as well as those who fail NIV, in whom mechanical ventilation is indicated. The optimal trial period for NIV is unknown. However, based upon data derived from patients with COPD, those who respond are likely to do so in the first two hours and patients who fail to respond within that time period have an increased chance of requiring mechanical ventilation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933406661\"><span class=\"h2\">Titration of oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who present with acute hypercapnic acidosis frequently (but not always) have co-existing hypoxemia that necessitates supplemental oxygen therapy. The degree of hypoxemia is variable and depends upon the cause of respiratory failure and presence of underlying chronic lung disease. The major concern with the delivery of oxygen to this population is the development of worsening hypercapnia and consequently acidosis. In this section, we discuss the risk of developing hypercapnia and how to safely administer and titrate oxygen in this population. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933408438\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration of oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is essential to administer oxygen to patients with significant hypoxemia to avoid the life-threatening complications of a low arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>). Thus, the <strong>primary goal</strong> of oxygen therapy in patients with hypoxemic hypercapnic respiratory failure is the adequate treatment of hypoxemia while the <strong>secondary goal</strong> is the avoidance of clinically significant worsening of hypercapnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-evaluation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-the-adult-patient-with-acute-hypercapnic-respiratory-failure/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Although the absolute lower limit of acceptable oxygenation in this population is unknown, in general, the target pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) should be 90 to 93 percent or a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 60 to 70 mmHg (8 to 9.3 kPa). However, on rare occasions in patients with severe chronic hypoxic hypercapnic respiratory failure, levels lower than that (eg, &ge;88 percent or PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;55 to 60 mmHg) may be maintained especially if it is close to their baseline and the patient is clinically stable (eg, normal mentation). </p><p>Our approach is the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-evaluation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-the-adult-patient-with-acute-hypercapnic-respiratory-failure/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with hypoxemic hypercapnic respiratory failure who are not already on oxygen, we initiate oxygen therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) to reach a target SpO<sub>2</sub> of 90 to 93 percent or a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 60 to 70 mmHg (8 to 9.3 kPa). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those who are estimated to require small amounts of supplemental oxygen, starting with low flow (eg, 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> or 24 to 28 percent FiO<sub>2</sub>) to achieve a SpO<sub>2</sub> at or close to this goal is appropriate. Gradual increases in increments of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> (via nasal cannula) or 4 to 7 percent (via venturi mask) with close monitoring of both PaO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> may be necessary to finally achieve the target SpO<sub>2</sub> of 90 to 93 percent. Once the target goal is achieved, supplemental oxygen can be maintained at this level and then weaned as the underlying disorder and hypercapnia resolves. The optimal rate of incremental increase is unknown but we prefer to increase the FiO<sub>2</sub> every 5 to 15 minutes; shorter periods of 5 minutes is usually adequate for patients with no underlying <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> mismatch while those with significant mismatch require longer periods for the change in FiO<sub>2</sub> to be fully reflected at the alveolar level (PAO<sub>2</sub>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Nasal cannulae are generally used initially by most clinicians for titrating oxygen. When using nasal cannula, the oxygen flow rate should generally be increased by 1 L per minute at a time; remembering that it is very difficult to predict the FiO<sub>2</sub> when administering supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula; this is because the FiO<sub>2</sub> associated with any given flow of oxygen delivered via nasal cannula depends on the patient's total ventilation and also depends upon whether the patient is breathing through their mouth or nose (many patients in respiratory distress primarily breathe through their mouth). Venturi masks may also be used to permit tight regulation of the maximum FiO<sub>2</sub> administered to the patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80020\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80020 \">figure 4</a>), but in general are employed when the patient is more stable after initial therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">By keeping the SpO<sub>2</sub> at or just above 90 percent, worsening hypoventilation can be detected via alarms triggered to a drop in O<sub>2</sub> saturation below 88 percent. Since hypoventilation leads to a decrease in alveolar PAO<sub>2</sub> and a consequent drop in arterial PaO<sub>2</sub>, keeping the O<sub>2</sub> saturation at the intersection between the ascending limb and the plateau of the hemoglobin-oxygen saturation curve (eg, PaO<sub>2</sub> 60 to 70 mmHg) will allow the clinician to closely monitor for the onset of hypoventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 5</a>). A fall in the SpO<sub>2</sub> should not be treated by giving more oxygen unless an ABG has demonstrated that hypercapnia is not the cause of the falling O<sub>2</sub> saturation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Importantly, prolonged episodes of severe hypoxemia should not be tolerated while titrating oxygen such that this approach works for patients who respond quickly (within 15 to 20 minutes) or who have no evidence of complications of hypoxemia (eg, chest pain, altered mental status, lactic acidosis) and require only small amounts of supplemental oxygen or minor adjustments to their FiO<sub>2</sub> to achieve adequate oxygenation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present with severe hypoxemia (eg, SpO<sub>2</sub> 65 percent) or for patients in whom the above strategy fails, supplemental oxygen should be simply administered at a FiO<sub>2</sub> that achieves adequate oxygenation (ie, SpO<sub>2</sub> 90 to 93 percent) and should worsening hypercapnia develop, noninvasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who develop severe respiratory acidosis (eg, pH &lt;7.2) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a marked depression in the level of consciousness using these strategies for oxygen administration, intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated. Lesser amounts of acidosis and milder symptoms may be treated with noninvasive ventilation and reductions in FiO<sub>2</sub> as tolerated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients in whom oxygen-induced hypercapnic respiratory failure is suspected and in whom the oxygen saturation is in the high normal range (eg, &gt;95 percent), lowering the supplemental oxygen to provide peripheral saturations between 90 and 93 percent is prudent while arterial blood gases are being drawn. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, a patient with obstructive sleep apnea may desaturate postoperatively due to global hypoventilation and be placed on 100 percent oxygen to improve peripheral saturation. While this may improve oxygenation, it may worsen hypercapnia and induce frank hypercapnic respiratory failure. In such cases, mechanical ventilation can be avoided by a reduction in supplemental oxygen with or without noninvasive ventilation. However, the clinician should avoid marked hypoxemia as FiO<sub>2</sub> is being reduced as this may result in both hypercapnia and hypoxemia, requiring endotracheal intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who develop oxygen-induced hypercapnic respiratory failure and have an oxygen saturation in the low normal range (eg, 88 to 93 percent in a patient with severe underlying chronic hypoxic hypercapnic respiratory failure), depending on the degree of respiratory failure, fine titration of supplemental oxygen with or without noninvasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation are options. Choosing among these options should be individualized and involve a pulmonologist or intensivist to facilitate management. Oxygen should <strong>not</strong> be removed entirely from the patient in an effort to avert intubation as this may aggravate tissue hypoxemia and worsen acidosis. </p><p/><p>While high flow nasal oxygen has a proven role in the treatment of hypoxemic respiratory failure, it has <strong>no</strong> proven role in the treatment of hypercapnic respiratory failure and should <strong>not</strong> be used. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933407493\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of hypercapnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hypercapnic effects of oxygen therapy have been studied in patients with COPD. In this population, most patients do not retain CO<sub>2</sub> when supplemental oxygen is administered (non-retainers).

The indications for and management of patients mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure, including those with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is discussed separately. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO<sub>2</sub> R) is a newer technique for removing carbon dioxide via venovenous bypass without affecting oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-evaluation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-the-adult-patient-with-acute-hypercapnic-respiratory-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. ECCO<sub>2</sub> R is being evaluated in the treatment of respiratory acidosis as a complication of the low tidal volume lung-protective ventilation with permissive hypercapnia. However, this technique requires more investigation before it can be routinely applied to this population as a specific treatment for hypercapnia. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412108849\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPIES OF UNPROVEN BENEFIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While respiratory stimulants have been used in the past (eg, medroxyprogesterone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>), they have no proven benefit in the treatment of acute (or chronic) hypercapnic states and have largely fallen out of favor. As such, we suggest <strong>not</strong> routinely using these agents. Similarly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> infusions should only be considered in patients with a true indication for its use (eg, severe symptomatic metabolic acidosis, tricyclic antidepressant overdose) because bicarbonate is not an effective buffer for acute respiratory acidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12669902\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercapnia is defined as an elevation in the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>). The CO<sub>2 </sub>level in arterial blood is directly proportional to the rate of carbon dioxide (VCO<sub>2</sub>) production and indirectly proportional to the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> elimination by the lung (alveolar ventilation). Alveolar ventilation is, in turn, determined by minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) and the ratio of dead space (V<sub>D</sub>) to tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>). Etiologies associated with hypercapnia are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F103091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103091 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercapnia should always be suspected in those who are at risk for hypoventilation<sub> </sub>(eg, sedatives), or increased physiologic dead space and limited pulmonary reserve (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation) who present with shortness of breath, a change in mental status, new hypoxemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypersomnolence. There are no clinical features that are sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of hypercapnia because the presenting features are usually those of hypercapnia itself as well as features due to the underlying disorder (eg, oxygen administration, sedatives, COPD). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When patients present with suspected hypercapnia the clinician should simultaneously assess and stabilize the airway, breathing, and circulation, perform a brief clinical bedside assessment with telemetry and oxygen monitoring, draw an arterial blood gas (ABG), and administer initial empiric bedside therapies. With this approach, once the diagnosis is made and the patient is stabilized, the etiology can usually be determined or narrowed to a few possibilities, such that subsequent testing and therapies can be appropriately tailored. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low clinical suspicion is all that is necessary to prompt ABG analysis for the diagnosis of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. The identification of an elevated PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;45 mmHg is diagnostic of hypercapnia. Hypercapnia should then be classified as acute (accompanying appropriate respiratory acidosis), chronic (a low-normal or near normal pH), or acute-on-chronic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79833\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79833 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58687\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58687 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63315\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63315 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A brief history and examination should be performed at the bedside so that therapies targeted at a specific underlying cause can be administered quickly. In addition to ABGs, a complete blood count, serum chemistries including bicarbonate and electrolytes, and a chest radiograph should be performed. Once the patient is stable, subsequent testing (eg, toxicology screen, thyroid function tests, chest or brain imaging) and therapies can then be appropriately tailored. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based upon a brief history, ABGs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory tests initial therapies that may be administered at the bedside include antidotes for sedative overdoses, bag-valve and noninvasive ventilation, oxygen titration, and empiric therapies targeted at the underlying etiology. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suitable candidates for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are patients with a moderate acute acidosis (eg, pH &lt;7.3) who are in moderate to severe respiratory distress, with tachypnea (respiratory rate &gt;25) and an increased work of breathing due to acute exacerbation of COPD. Additional candidates include those with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, post-extubation respiratory failure, and patients with obstructive sleep apnea and neuromuscular disorders. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with hypoxemic hypercapnic respiratory failure we initiate oxygen therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) to reach a target peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of 90 to 93 percent or a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 60 to 70 mmHg (8 to 9.3 kPa) rather than higher saturations or PaO<sub>2</sub> levels. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are estimated to require small amounts of supplemental FiO2, low flow oxygen, should be administered (eg, 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> or 24 to 28 percent FiO<sub>2</sub>) to achieve a SpO2 at or close to this goal. Gradual increases (every 10 to 15 minutes) in increments of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> (via nasal cannula) or 4 to 7 percent (via venturi mask) with close monitoring of both PaO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> may be necessary to finally achieve the target SpO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80020\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80020 \">figure 4</a>). Prolonged episodes of hypoxemia should be avoided during titration. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present with severe hypoxemia (eg, SpO<sub>2</sub> 65 percent) or for patients in whom the above strategy fails, supplemental oxygen should be administered at a FiO<sub>2</sub> that achieves adequate oxygenation (ie, SpO<sub>2</sub> 90 to 93 percent) and should worsening hypercapnia develop, noninvasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The development of acute hypercapnia with significant acidemia (eg, pH &lt;7.2) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a marked depression in the level of consciousness is usually an indication for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Lesser amounts of acidosis and milder symptoms may be treated with NIV and reductions in FiO<sub>2</sub> as tolerated. Oxygen should not be removed entirely from the patient in an effort to avert intubation as this may aggravate tissue hypoxemia and worsen acidosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is diagnosed on arterial blood gas analysis by the demonstration of an elevated PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;45 mmHg with an accompanying appropriate respiratory acidosis. The differential diagnosis of the symptoms of hypercapnia and distinguishing the etiologies of hypercapnia from one another are typically dependent upon a collection of clinical features supported by laboratory, imaging, and physiologic findings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance therapy is primarily directed at treating the underlying disorder and reversing the acute hypercapnia back to baseline levels. Baseline for most patients is normocapnia. However, in patients who are chronically hypercapnic prior to admission, targeting a PaCO<sub>2</sub> that approximates their pre-morbid state is prudent. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-evaluation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-the-adult-patient-with-acute-hypercapnic-respiratory-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Davidson AC, Banham S, Elliott M, et al.
