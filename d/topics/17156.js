The information in this topic applies to patients who are ventilated through an endotracheal tube, tracheostomy tube, or noninvasive interface. Modes of mechanical ventilation are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS OF THE VENTILATOR CIRCUIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ventilator circuit refers to the tubing that connects the ventilator to a patient, as well as any device that is connected to the circuit tubing. The most common devices include heaters and humidifiers, filters, suction catheters, and nebulizers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1491054029\"><span class=\"h2\">Circuit tubing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tubing that connects the ventilator to the patient is generally corrugated plastic, which has universal connectors (22 mm inside diameter) that connect the ventilator to the endotracheal tube (ETT), tracheostomy tube, or noninvasive interface. There are two types of circuits commonly used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dual limb circuit &ndash; Dual limb circuits are used for critical care ventilators; these have inspiratory and expiratory valves. The expiratory valve actively closes during the inspiratory phase and the inspiratory valve closes during the expiratory phase. There is separate tubing for the inspiratory gas and the expiratory gas. In this way rebreathing is minimized. With the dual circuit design, the inspiratory and expiratory valves are typically inside the ventilator. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single limb circuit &ndash; Two types of single limb circuits are available:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For portable ventilators with an active exhalation valve, a single limb circuit is used with the exhalation valve near the patient. Because the expiratory valve is near the patient, rebreathing is minimized. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For bilevel ventilators, a single limb circuit is used with a leak port, which allows passive exhalation by the patient. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4226151142\"><span class=\"h2\">Characteristics of the ventilator circuit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dead space and compression volume are important characteristics of the ventilator circuit. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dead space</strong> &ndash; Mechanical dead space is that part of the circuit through which the patient rebreathes, and is thus an extension of the anatomic dead space. Mechanical dead space decreases alveolar ventilation and increases the partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>). This is particularly an issue when low-tidal-volume lung-protective ventilation is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Dead space is increased by adding volume between the Y-piece and the patient interface. Examples of increased mechanical dead space include excessive connecting tubing and passive humidifiers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Compression volume</strong> &ndash; When the circuit is pressurized, gas is compressed in the circuit and the volume of the circuit increased due to its compliance. As much as 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/cm</span> H<sub>2</sub>O can be compressed in the ventilator circuit. Thus, for a peak airway pressure of 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and PEEP of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, about 100 mL of the gas will be compressed in the ventilator circuit and not delivered to the patient during inspiration. For patients ventilated with a small tidal volume, compressible gas volume can greatly affect alveolar ventilation. Fortunately, most modern ventilators determine the compressible volume during the pre-use check and adjust for the effects of compressible volume. Thus, the volume selected and displayed on the ventilator represents the actual delivered tidal volume after correction for the effect of compressible volume.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Heaters and humidifiers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During mechanical ventilation, inspired gas is generally warmed and humidified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is necessary to prevent desiccated respiratory secretions and consequently atelectasis during mechanical ventilation (since the ETT or tracheostomy bypasses the normal warming and humidification functions of the upper airway). During invasive mechanical ventilation, the inspired gas should be conditioned to near body conditions. This is typically 100 percent relative humidity at body temperature (ie, 44 mg of water per liter of gas). To avoid over-humidification, the temperature of gas delivered should be set to the patient&rsquo;s core body temperature. Humidification is also necessary during noninvasive ventilation for patient comfort, but is usually not set at body conditions because the upper airway in intact.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Humidifiers</strong> &ndash; Active humidification occurs when a humidifier in the ventilator circuit warms and humidifies the inspired gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Passive humidification uses a device called an artificial nose (heat and moisture exchanger) to trap the heat and humidity in the exhaled gas and delivers that to the patient during the subsequent inspiration. Some passive humidifiers also serve as filters, thus reducing circuit contamination from the patient, but the importance of this is unclear. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Choosing among passive or active options is typically based upon institution and clinician preference, since meta-analyses have shown that neither active nor passive strategies result in different rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), mortality, or respiratory complications (eg, episodes of airway occlusion, frequency of atelectasis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Several important differences that should be considered when choosing a humidifier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The cost of passive humidification may be less expensive than active humidification</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Passive humidifiers are less effective than active humidifiers, which may lead to a greater risk of airway occlusion if not monitored closely</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Passive humidifiers have higher resistance to flow, which may be problematic in spontaneous breathing modes (eg, pressure support ventilation) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Passive humidifiers increase dead space volume, which can be problematic during low tidal volume ventilation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Active humidifiers do not need to be changed at regular intervals since they are considered part of ventilator circuit and studies have shown that frequent changes are not beneficial. (see <a href=\"#H3693632700\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of ventilator circuit change'</a> below). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Passive humidifiers can be safely used for at least 48 hours in most patients and even longer (eg, up to seven days) with better performing devices in patients without significant airway secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients who potentially require more frequent changes include those with obstructive airways disease, copious airway secretions, or frequent clogging with secretions. If frequent clogging is an issue, switching to an active humidifier is appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heated circuit</strong> &ndash; In modern ventilator circuits, heated wires are placed in the inspiratory and expiratory tubing to reduce the formation of condensate when an active humidifier is used. When the gas in the inspiratory circuit is warmed to a temperature greater than the humidifier, the absolute humidity remains the same but the decrease in relative humidity results in no condensate in the inspiratory limb. Similarly, when the gas in the expiratory circuit is warmed to a temperature greater than exhaled gas, the absolute humidity remains the same but the decrease in relative humidity results in no condensate in the expiratory limb. On some systems, the user can adjust the gradient between the humidifier and circuit temperatures, whereas other systems do this automatically. It is important that the gas delivered to the patient has both an adequate absolute humidity (44 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> and relative humidity (100 percent). A common clinical error is to reduce the water output of the humidifier, which results in a dry circuit, but reduces the absolute humidity delivery to the patient. The result may be drying of secretions and endotracheal tube occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. To ensure adequate humidification of the inspired gas, the temperature of the gas entering the airway should be 37&ordm;C and the temperature differential in the circuit should be adjusted to the point at which condensation forms near the patient&rsquo;s airway. This indicates that gas is fully saturated at body temperature. If no condensate is visible, the clinician has no way of knowing what is the relative humidity, and it might be very low. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Humidification does not affect the rate of VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, the heated wire circuit does reduce the risk that a patient receives a bolus of contaminated circuit condensate into the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It also reduces the inconvenience of disposing of circuit condensate, a process that can contaminate the healthcare provider, which could lead to the provider transmitting infection to other patients. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H915203303\"><span class=\"h2\">Filters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial filters are sometimes placed at the inlet and the outlet of the ventilator circuit. The inspiratory filter is intended to minimize delivery of microorganisms from the gas supply to the patient, whereas the expiratory filter is intended to minimize contamination of the environment from the exhaled breath of the patient. Filters may also be placed in the expiratory limb during aerosol delivery to minimize the risk of malfunction of expiratory flow sensors due to contamination with aerosol. It is important that expiratory filters are changed after each nebulizer treatment, or every two to four hours when continuous aerosols are administered, because the filter can increase the expiratory resistance for the patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Suction equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tracheal secretions are removed during mechanical ventilation by passing a suction catheter through the endotracheal tube. Closed suction systems are used in many hospitals. With a closed suction system, the suction catheter is part of the ventilator circuit and, therefore, the patient can be suctioned without being disconnected from the ventilator. With an open suction system, the patient is disconnected from the ventilator and then the suction catheter is passed through the endotracheal tube. Although neither system is superior to the other in preventing VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], closed systems are generally used since they prevent exposure of staff to contaminated condensate and tracheal secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Moreover, there is less respiratory and hemodynamic derangement during suctioning because the patient remains connected to the ventilator and thus positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) are better maintained. </p><p>Since closed suction catheters are considered part of the ventilator circuit, they are not changed routinely, a practice that is supported by numerous studies that have shown that daily changes of suction catheters does not reduce the frequency of VAP or other respiratory complications compared to less frequent changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3693632700\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of ventilator circuit change'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Nebulizers and inhalers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled medications, typically bronchodilators, can be introduced into the ventilator circuit by a metered dose inhalator, jet nebulizer, or mesh nebulizer. The choice of delivery device is usually determined by institutional and clinician preference. Factors that should be taken into consideration include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational evidence reports increased risk of VAP in association with jet nebulizer use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This is likely because the jet nebulizer can become contaminated when solution is added to the cup. Also, the nebulizer surface can contaminate the ventilator circuit when it is added. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of contamination might be lower with the metered-dose inhaler because it is not part of the ventilator circuit; only the stem of the inhaler is introduced into the actuator port. Use of metered-dose inhaler during mechanical ventilation has be reportedly associated with a low risk of VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cost of metered-dose inhalers has increased with the conversion to hydrofluoroalkane&nbsp;(HFA) propellant. This has resulted in the development of less expensive alternatives, such as mesh nebulizers. The mesh nebulizer is incorporated into the ventilator circuit and has been reportedly associated with a low risk of VAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Additional details regarding delivery of inhaled bronchodilators during mechanical and noninvasive ventilation are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of inhaled medication in adults&quot;, section on 'Mechanically ventilated patients'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-adults#H2275128272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delivery of inhaled medication in adults&quot;, section on 'Patients receiving noninvasive ventilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690957485\"><span class=\"h2\">Other inhaled gases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gases other than air and oxygen can be delivered during mechanical ventilation. Most common are inhaled nitric oxide (INO) and heliox. Heliox is introduced to the gas inlet of the actual ventilator (ie, same place the oxygen is introduced). INO, however, is introduced directly into the ventilator circuit via a specific <span class=\"nowrap\">port/adaptor</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-clinical-use-of-heliox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and clinical use of heliox&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-nitric-oxide-in-adults-biology-and-indications-for-use#H1197889080\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhaled nitric oxide in adults: Biology and indications for use&quot;, section on 'Administration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H954129528\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring devices might be introduced into the circuit, typically between the Y-piece and endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. They include carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> monitors (ie, capnography), pressure monitors, and flow sensors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Bag-valve resuscitator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bag-valve resuscitators kept at the bedside of mechanically ventilated patients to allow emergency ventilation should there be a ventilator failure. Use of the bag-valve resuscitator should be minimized by using strategies such a closed suction and portable ventilators during patient transport. These devices are often contaminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Although strategies to reduce such contamination have not been studied, it is prudent to cap the patient connection of the bag-valve resuscitator when it is not in use. Similarly, it is prudent to cap the ventilator's Y-piece tubing when the ventilator is disconnected from the patient (eg, during prolonged spontaneous breathing trials). Either single patient use devices should be used, or the device should be cleaned and sterilized between patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3218448764\"><span class=\"h1\">TROUBLESHOOTING PROBLEMS WITH THE CIRCUIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance of the ventilator circuit is crucial for adequate ventilation. The ventilator circuit should be inspected on a regular basis, such as a patient-ventilator system check by a respiratory therapist every four hours. Common problems include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detachment &ndash; The circuit can detach from the patient if not attached snuggly, which results in an immediate disconnect alarm on the ventilator. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air leaks &ndash; Leaks can occur at any connection point in the circuit. A leak will result in the ventilator displaying an exhaled tidal volume lower than the volume delivered from the ventilator, prompting the clinician to correct the leak. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive condensate &ndash; When a heated humidifier is used, excessive condensate can accumulate in the circuit. This should be removed aseptically without interrupting ventilation, and water traps might be useful to accomplish this. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clogged passive humidifier &ndash; If an artificial nose (heat and moisture exchanger) is used for humidification, it can become clogged with secretions, which may result in a high-pressure alarm on the ventilator. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3693632700\"><span class=\"h1\">FREQUENCY OF VENTILATOR CIRCUIT CHANGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence-based guidelines recommend that ventilator circuits are not changed on a routine basis, but only if they malfunction or are visibly soiled, and between patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>]. Ventilator circuits should not be changed routinely for infection control purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>]. These recommendations are based upon randomized trials and observational data that report no difference in the rate of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) or mortality in association with frequent circuit changes compared with less frequent changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/21-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-28</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial that randomly assigned 63 mechanically ventilated patients to have their ventilator circuit changed every 48 hours or not at all reported no difference in the rate of VAP (31.4 versus 28.5 percent), mortality, or duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another randomized trial of 300 patients, there was no difference in the rate of VAP (25 versus 29 percent) or mortality in patients receiving no circuit changes compared with those receiving changes every seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One observational study of 637 mechanically ventilated patients reported an increased rate of VAP among those with frequent circuit changes (every two days) compared with those changed every 7 or every 30 days (12 versus 3 or 6 episodes per 1000 ventilator days). </p><p/><p>The same lack of benefit from frequent circuit changes has also been found among patients who are mechanically ventilated in subacute centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. &#160;</p><p>This practice is further supported by evidence which suggests that the ventilator circuit plays a minimal role on the development of VAP: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspiration of contaminated pharyngeal secretions is the predominant cause of nosocomial pneumonia, not inhalation of aerosols containing bacteria. Thus, strategies to minimized pooling of secretions above the cuff of the artificial airway are recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The microorganisms that colonize the ventilator circuit originate in the patient rather than the circuit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-ventilator-circuit/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This suggests that the patient contaminates the circuit, rather than the circuit contaminating the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1352446742\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
