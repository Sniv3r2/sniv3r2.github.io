In addition, patients who suffer from chronic compartment lower extremity syndromes may also benefit from fasciotomy.</p><p>For acute compartment syndrome, failure to recognize and decompress the muscular compartments in a timely fashion can compromise the extremity or the patient's life.

In such cases, prophylactic fasciotomy should be performed in conjunction with the index operation, which prevents the need to return to the operating room. The techniques for prophylactic fasciotomy are the same as for emergent fasciotomy. (See <a href=\"#H428235648\" class=\"local\">'Fasciotomy techniques'</a> below.)</p><p>The need to perform prophylactic fasciotomy is not always easily defined in vascular patients because of potential problems with subsequent wound healing, or in orthopedic patients with hardware-related issues. </p><p>For vascular procedures, prophylactic fasciotomy may be indicated for patients when [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic time is prolonged (eg, prolonged clamp time), but the severity of ischemia is probably a more important factor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute arterial occlusion is sudden in onset and collateral flow is not sufficient (eg, thromboembolism)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined arterial and venous injuries are present as seen in traumatic injuries</p><p/><p>For orthopedic procedures, prophylactic fasciotomy may be indicated for patients with [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comminuted fractures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tibial fractures, especially those involving the diaphysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures associated with arterial injury</p><p/><p>The timely recognition of a postoperative acute compartment syndrome is predicated on the ability to perform serial examinations on a responsive, neurologically intact patient. Thus, prophylactic fasciotomy may be more appropriate in patients at risk for compartment syndrome but for whom a reliable clinical examination (altered mental status, neurologic deficit) cannot be performed. </p><p>Whether complications are reduced or outcomes are improved for prophylactic fasciotomy compared with waiting until a compartment syndrome is diagnosed is debated. In most patients, prophylactic fasciotomy is not indicated, and careful clinical assessment and compartment pressure monitoring will indicate the need for fasciotomy. (See <a href=\"#H443279421\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic versus therapeutic fasciotomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H428236833\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fasciotomy is contraindicated when the extremity is nonviable either due to multiple injuries or due to severe tissue ischemia. The duration of ischemia is often unknown and is unreliable for judging the degree of ischemia. Waxing and waning <span class=\"nowrap\">perfusion/hypoperfusion</span> may have a worse prognosis compared with sudden complete hypoperfusion. Grade III extremity ischemia (irreversible) is generally a contraindication to revascularization, and is clinically evident as a cold extremity with muscle rigor, complete neurologic deficit, and no audible Doppler signals.

The magnitude of the reperfusion insult may be so severe that sudden cardiac arrest can occur as a consequence. To avoid this outcome, some authors have advocated primary amputation if profound ischemia is present for greater than 10 hours in a patient with limited collaterals. The rationale for this seemingly radical approach is based upon the potential for life-threatening complications, coupled with a low potential for functional recovery after prolonged, profound ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

However, at times, a critically ill patient may be too unstable for transportation. Under these circumstances, fasciotomy can be undertaken in the intensive care unit with local anesthesia, and conscious sedation as tolerated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16956434\"><span class=\"h2\">Instrumentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the only instruments required to perform a fasciotomy are a scalpel for the skin incision, electrocautery for the skin incision and hemostasis, and scissors for the fasciotomy. The type of scissors depends upon the anatomic location. For lower leg fasciotomy, a pair of large, blunt-tipped scissors (eg, Cooley or Metzenbaum) is ideal. Releasing compartments in the foot requires greater precision and a finer pair of scissors (eg, Jameson, Iris). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16956492\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to fasciotomy, we recommend antibiotic prophylaxis to cover skin organisms ideally one hour prior to the incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87206 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One trial evaluated the use of antibiotics in 100 patients prior to leg fasciotomy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single preoperative dose of 200 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> or no antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The incidence of wound infection was significantly reduced in the group that received antibiotic prophylaxis (2.2 versus 12.9 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16956500\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fasciotomy can be performed safely in the face of antithrombotic therapy, although meticulous attention to technique and hemostasis are needed to minimize perioperative bleeding. Antiplatelet agents pose no contraindication to fasciotomy and may be beneficial in limiting thrombosis of the microcirculation. Among patients with vascular etiologies for acute compartment syndrome who are anticoagulated, it is preferable to continue therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy#H443284358\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient management following extremity fasciotomy&quot;, section on 'Role of anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, patients with an orthopedic etiology for the acute compartment syndrome or patients with multiple injures may have a greater risk of bleeding. Thus, the maintenance or discontinuation of antithrombotic therapy prior to fasciotomy should be individualized. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16956442\"><span class=\"h2\">Other considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decompression of muscle compartments may liberate products of cellular breakdown if significant myonecrosis has occurred. Ischemia-reperfusion manifests clinically as acidosis and hyperkalemia. In the operating room it is prudent to forewarn the anesthesia team of the expected severity and timing of reperfusion, so that the patient is monitored and treated appropriately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy#H443284400\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient management following extremity fasciotomy&quot;, section on 'Management of reperfusion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H428235648\"><span class=\"h1\">FASCIOTOMY TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nature of the fasciotomy technique depends upon the underlying condition or mechanism that precipitated the compartment syndrome. The discussion that follows will focus primarily on the treatment of acute compartment syndrome. Prophylactic fasciotomy is performed using the same techniques. Alternative considerations for elective fasciotomy are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H428235599\" class=\"local\">'Alternative fasciotomy techniques for elective compartment decompression'</a> below.)</p><p>There is currently little consensus over what constitutes best practice for performing emergent lower extremity fasciotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The available evidence comes from case series and retrospective reviews. It is our preference to manage acute compartment syndrome aggressively with techniques that include the use of generous skin incisions that are left open, generous fascial incisions and opening any compartment affected by or at risk for developing compartment syndrome. Although it is tempting to limit the number of compartments to those with obviously elevated pressure, we advise fasciotomy on any muscle compartment within the zone of maximal ischemia or injury. One potential exception to this guideline relates to fasciotomy of the thigh, which is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H548658775\" class=\"local\">'Thigh fasciotomy'</a> below.) </p><p>The length of the lower extremity skin incisions for emergent fasciotomy has been the focus of considerable debate. Some surgeons use minimal skin incisions with more extensive fascial incisions when profound muscle swelling is not anticipated. However, this approach places the patient at risk for recurrent compartment syndrome. The degree of muscle swelling following reperfusion is due to many factors, and may not be predictable at the time of surgery. Peak muscle edema following decompressive fasciotomy may not be fully evident for many hours after surgery. (See <a href=\"#H443276740\" class=\"local\">'Ischemia-reperfusion'</a> below.)</p><p>One retrospective study observed that 12 percent of lower extremity fasciotomies performed with minimal incisions required reoperation to achieve complete decompression of the compartments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Decreased compliance of the overlying stretched skin can maintain elevated intra-compartment pressures. In a study of eight trauma patients, intra-compartment pressures were measured while performing four-compartment leg fasciotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The initial 8 cm skin incision reduced intra-compartment pressure from an average of 48 mmHg to 25 mmHg. However, one-third of the compartments treated had residually elevated pressures. Extension of the incisions to achieve an average 16 cm incision length resulted in a reduction of the intra-compartment pressures to an average level of 13 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548658747\"><span class=\"h2\">Leg fasciotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the anterior compartment of the leg is the most susceptible of the leg compartments to compartment syndrome, each of the four compartments of the leg should always be decompressed during emergent fasciotomy. Both double-incision and single-incision techniques for leg fasciotomy have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. There are no randomized trials to support one approach over the other and retrospective studies have found no significant differences in overall outcomes between these two techniques. The double incision fasciotomy is preferred by most surgeons due to its simplicity and improved exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284706545\"><span class=\"h3\">Double incision fasciotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two incision four-compartment fasciotomy uses medial and lateral longitudinal incisions that should be at least 12 to 20 cm in length. </p><p>The lateral incision of the double-incision fasciotomy is centered between the fibular shaft and the crest of the tibia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80994\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80994 \">figure 5</a>). In this location, the incision overlies the intermuscular septum between the anterior and lateral compartments. In normal weight patients, this septum is palpable as a subtle indentation approximately 4 to 5 cm lateral to the tibia. After the lateral incision has been made, skin and subcutaneous flaps are developed medially and laterally to expose the fascia of the intermuscular septum and the fascia of the anterior and lateral compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70951\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70951 \">figure 6</a>). The intermuscular septum must be identified to ensure that both the anterior and lateral compartments are decompressed. The anterior compartment fascia is incised (electrocautery or scalpel). The fascial incisions are extended proximally and distally using scissors (eg, Metzenbaum, Cooley) taking care to sufficiently elevate the posterior blade of the scissors off the muscle to avoid cutting muscle-associated nerves. Once the anterior compartment is decompressed, the procedure is performed on the lateral compartment. Extension of the anterior or lateral fascial incisions too proximally can injure the common peroneal nerve or its superficial and deep branches. Termination of the proximal extent of the fasciotomy at a point 4 to 5 cm distal to the fibular head minimizes the risk of a nerve injury. </p><p>The medial incision of the double-incision fasciotomy is placed 1 to 2 cm medial to the tibial margin in a position similar to that used to expose the infrageniculate popliteal artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80994\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80994 \">figure 5</a>). The distal extent of the medial incision should be based on the extent of muscle swelling. In cases in which there is profound swelling, the incision should extend at least two-thirds of the distance to the medial malleolus. The saphenous vein and nerve should be identified and retracted to avoid injury. Failure to identify the vein and nerve are a frequent cause of injury to these structures. The superficial posterior compartment is decompressed by incising the gastrocnemius fascia in a longitudinal direction from proximal to distal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70951\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70951 \">figure 6</a>). The deep posterior compartment is decompressed by dividing the attachments of the soleus muscle to the tibia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284706555\"><span class=\"h3\">Single incision fasciotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single-incision four-compartment fasciotomy is technically more challenging but offers the obvious advantage of one incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The disadvantage of this approach is the difficulty visualizing the deep posterior compartment and, therefore, an increased risk of injury to the peroneal artery and nerve. Most surgeons find the double-incision technique simpler, more expeditious and a safer method to decompress the leg. (See <a href=\"#H284706545\" class=\"local\">'Double incision fasciotomy'</a> above.)</p><p>The single-incision technique uses a generous lateral leg incision 1 cm anterior to the fibula and parallel to it, extending from just inferior to the head of the fibula to 3 to 4 cm proximal to the lateral malleolus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80994\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80994 \">figure 5</a>). Extensive anterior flaps are created to expose the anterior and lateral compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55311 \">figure 7</a>). As with the double incision technique, longitudinal incisions are made in fascia of the anterior and lateral compartments, taking care to avoid injury to the common, superficial and deep peroneal nerves near the fibular head.</p><p>The lateral flap is extended posteriorly to expose the superficial posterior compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55311 \">figure 7</a>). Once the gastrocnemius is identified, its fascia is incised longitudinally. The deep posterior compartment is accessed in a plane developed between the lateral and superficial posterior compartment which exposes the posterior margin of the fibula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55311 \">figure 7</a>). The soleus is dissected from the posterior aspect of the fibula beginning distally where the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles are more tendinous. During the peri-fibular dissection, the peroneal vessels should be retracted posteriorly to avoid injury.</p><p>Fibulectomy is no longer advocated because it unnecessarily risks injury to the peroneal artery and nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, some surgeons find that the deep posterior compartment is more easily decompressed by removal of the fibula when it is already fractured and displaced. When performing single incision fasciotomy, it is argued that the fascia of the posterior tibial muscle should be decompressed separately; however, this is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548658775\"><span class=\"h2\">Thigh fasciotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thigh compartment syndrome is an uncommon clinical entity. Crush injuries and blunt trauma with femur fracture are the most common mechanisms associated with thigh compartment syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. The mechanism of injury required to cause a thigh compartment syndrome places the patient at risk for &quot;crush syndrome&quot; and its complications, including acute kidney injury due to myoglobinuria. In a series of 17 patients with thigh compartment syndrome, &quot;crush syndrome&quot; with myoglobinuria and renal failure developed in nearly half of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The presence of a thigh compartment syndrome warrants careful monitoring for myoglobinuria and aggressive treatment to blunt the nephrotoxic effects. The anterior and posterior compartments of the thigh are more susceptible to acute compartment syndrome than the medial compartment. (See <a href=\"#H443276740\" class=\"local\">'Ischemia-reperfusion'</a> below.)</p><p>A single, generous lateral incision is made that originates from a point just distal to the intertrochanteric line and extended to the lateral epicondyle of the femur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Through this incision, the iliotibial band and fascia of the vastus lateralis are incised the full length of the skin incision to decompress the anterior compartment. The posterior compartment is decompressed by reflecting the vastus lateralis muscle medially to expose the lateral intermuscular septum, which is incised the length of the skin incision. </p><p>Because the medial compartment of the thigh is less prone to acute compartment syndrome, the intra-compartment pressure should be measured prior to undertaking medial compartment fasciotomy. A second incision overlying the adductor muscle group is used for medial thigh compartment decompression. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548658782\"><span class=\"h2\">Buttock fasciotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute compartment syndrome of the buttocks can be a consequence of rupture of the superior gluteal or medial circumflex femoral arteries, pelvic fracture, hypogastric artery embolization or prolonged immobilization (eg, intraoperative, unconsciousness due to overdose or intoxication) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. </p><p>Each of the three fascial compartments of the buttock should be incised for full decompression.

Some reports also describe performing neurolysis of the sciatic nerve as an adjunctive component of the operation to ensure that the nerve does not come under tension from inflammatory adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548658789\"><span class=\"h2\">Foot fasciotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute compartment syndrome of the foot is typically due to crush injury. Foot fasciotomy can be performed through either a dorsal, lateral or medial approach. Regardless of which technique is used, each of the muscle compartments should be opened to fully decompress the foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/7,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,35,36</a>]. The dorsal approach is described below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67034 \">figure 8</a>). </p><p>Two or three incisions are needed for the dorsal approach. Two dorsal longitudinal incisions provide access to each of the foot compartments. The incisions are positioned medial to the second metatarsal bone and lateral to the fourth metatarsal bone. Each of the four sub-compartments of the interosseous compartment are opened between the metatarsal bones through the dorsal incisions. The calcaneal compartment, which lies beneath the metatarsals, is opened directly. The medial compartment may be accessed by dissecting medial to the second metatarsal. Alternatively, the medial compartment can be accessed through another incision along the medial foot, immediately posterior to the first metatarsal. The lateral compartment is decompressed through the lateral dorsal incision. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H428235599\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative fasciotomy techniques for elective compartment decompression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic exertional compartment syndrome is a condition that affects typically young, athletic patients. It is manifested by pain overlying the affected muscle compartment during exercise. Most commonly, the anterior compartment is affected, with pain beginning 20 to 30 minutes after exercise is initiated and ceasing after 15 to 30 minutes of rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Paresthesias in the cutaneous distribution of the nerves that traverse the affected compartment may be present. Diagnosis requires measurement of intra-compartment pressures with criteria proposed by Pedowitz that include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-exercise pressure &ge;15 mmHg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1 minute postexercise pressure of &ge;30 mmHg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5 minute postexercise pressure &ge;20 mmHg</p><p/><p>Presence of typical symptoms with any of these intra-compartment pressure criteria is sufficient to indicate the need for fasciotomy.

Rather than opening all compartments, only those compartments with symptoms are treated. In addition, minimally invasive techniques may be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In the vast majority of cases, symptoms affect the anterior and lateral compartments. Both fasciotomy and fasciectomy have been used to open these compartments. </p><p>Subcutaneous fasciotomy of the anterior and lateral compartments is performed using two transverse skin incisions overlying the anterolateral lower leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59617 \">figure 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These incisions are oriented strategically at the proximal and distal ends of the planned fasciotomies in the anterior and lateral compartments. Using the two skin incisions, the anterior and lateral compartments are identified and blunt-tipped (Cooley or Metzenbaum) scissors are used to extend the fascial incisions between the two skin incisions. </p><p>Fasciectomy is performed through a lateral longitudinal skin incision overlying the intermuscular septum between the anterior and lateral compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F80994\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80994 \">figure 5</a>). Using this incision, standard fasciotomies of the anterior and lateral compartments are first performed as described above for the double incision fasciotomy. In addition, an ellipse of fascia is resected (&quot;fasciectomy&quot;), preserving the fascia overlying the intermuscular septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59617 \">figure 9</a>). </p><p>Based on a series of nearly 800 patients treated with these approaches, one author advocates fasciectomy to ensure more complete fascial release for patients with chronic exertional compartment syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443276740\"><span class=\"h1\">ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As each muscle compartment is opened, discoloration of the muscle, which may be focal or complete, confirms the presence of significant ischemia. Once a fascial compartment is released, increased perfusion of the muscle should improve its color. The local response to reperfusion leads to extremity swelling that frequently complicates wound management.

However, technical errors occurring during the fasciotomy procedure and the open fasciotomy wounds can be a source of morbidity. Complications associated with the technical aspects of lower extremity fasciotomy are discussed below. Other associated complications are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy#H443283619\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient management following extremity fasciotomy&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443278533\"><span class=\"h2\">Incomplete fasciotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incomplete fasciotomy occurs when the fascial incisions are not adequate to permit complete decompression of the compartment. In one study, recurrent compartment syndrome due to incomplete fasciotomy was reported in 13 percent of patients undergoing leg fasciotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Generous skin and fascial openings (12 to 20 cm) are needed to fully decompress the leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H428235648\" class=\"local\">'Fasciotomy techniques'</a> above.)</p><p>Incomplete fasciotomy may result from two distinct technical errors. Either a compartment is inadequately decompressed or it was not opened because the operating surgeon elected to forego fasciotomy of certain compartments based upon a perception that these compartments were at low risk for developing a compartment syndrome. As an example, a decision to perform a fasciotomy on the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg may be based upon elevated intra-compartment pressures but the posterior compartments are spared due to lower pressure measurements. The danger of this approach lies in an inability to predict the evolution of muscle swelling and therefore intra-compartment pressures in the compartments that have not been decompressed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-management-following-extremity-fasciotomy#H443283570\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient management following extremity fasciotomy&quot;, section on 'Ischemia-reperfusion'</a>.)</p><p>In other cases, the failure to decompress a muscle compartment may be unintentional. As an example, two parallel fasciotomies may have been performed within the same compartment, such as the anterior compartment of the lower leg, rather than in adjacent anterior and lateral compartments as intended. This technical error typically occurs because the intermuscular septum between the anterior and lateral compartments had not been identified at the time of the initial fasciotomy. With leg fasciotomies, one study found that the anterior and deep posterior compartments were the most likely to be unopened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16956529\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurovascular injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injuries to arteries and nerves due to technical issues are specific to the fasciotomy site. In one study, injury to the superficial peroneal nerve occurred in 6 percent of patients undergoing emergent leg fasciotomy for trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This injury is generally due to failure to recognize the nerve while extending either the anterior or lateral compartment fascial incision proximally. Superficial peroneal nerve injury is avoided first by knowledge of the normal and variant anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76717\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76717 \">figure 3</a>) of this nerve and stopping the proximal fascial incision of the anterior and lateral compartment 4 to 5 cm distal to the fibular head. (See <a href=\"#H428235727\" class=\"local\">'Superficial peroneal nerve'</a> above.)</p><p>The peroneal artery is at risk for injury with the single-incision technique for lower leg fasciotomy, particularly if a fibulectomy is performed. (See <a href=\"#H284706555\" class=\"local\">'Single incision fasciotomy'</a> above.)</p><p>Neurovascular injuries are rare in performing thigh fasciotomies because these structures are located deep within the muscle compartments. During fasciotomy of the buttocks, the sciatic nerve must be carefully identified for the purposes of neurolysis which prevents subsequent nerve entrapment. </p><p>Foot fasciotomy places the medial and lateral plantar neurovascular bundles at risk and care must be taken to avoid their injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These structures are most commonly encountered with the medial foot incision.</p><p>Subcutaneous fasciotomy for chronic exertional compartment syndrome is often performed through two small incisions. The result is a relatively high rate (5 percent) of neurovascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In contrast, in one case series, fasciectomy was associated with no neurovascular injuries which is likely related to the larger incisions and improved exposure with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The discussion that follows will focus on the outcomes for emergent fasciotomy. The prognosis of the treatment of chronic compartment syndrome is discussed elsewhere.

Failure to recognize acute compartment syndrome and decompress the muscle compartments in a timely fashion can compromise the extremity or lead to life-threatening complications. In the lower extremity, the leg is the site most commonly in need of fasciotomy but the thigh, buttock, or foot can also be affected. Patients who suffer from chronic compartment syndromes may also benefit from fasciotomy. (See <a href=\"#H548658733\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16956064\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knowledge of lower extremity compartment anatomy and anatomic variation is important to ensure a complete fasciotomy and decrease the potential for neurovascular complications. In general, fasciotomy is accomplished by making a skin incision overlying a muscle compartment or group of compartments. The skin is reflected to expose the fascia of the compartment and an incision is made in the fascia and extended longitudinally to fully open the fascia proximally and distally. (See <a href=\"#H16956073\" class=\"local\">'Compartment anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H428235648\" class=\"local\">'Fasciotomy techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend prophylactic antibiotics prior to lower extremity fasciotomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

In contrast, thigh fasciotomy often requires only a single lateral incision to open the anterior and posterior compartment. Medial thigh fasciotomy may not be needed, but should be performed if compartment pressures are elevated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not routinely performing prophylactic fasciotomy in anticipation of compartment syndrome (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Compartment pressures should be carefully monitored in patients at risk. However, patients undergoing certain orthopedic or vascular surgical procedures in which significant increases in extremity swelling are anticipated may benefit from prophylactic fasciotomy. (See <a href=\"#H443285312\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic fasciotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fasciotomy is an effective treatment for patients with chronic compartment syndrome. The techniques used to decompress the compartments are similar to those used for acute compartment syndrome, although compartments are selectively decompressed and minimally invasive techniques can be used. (See <a href=\"#H428235599\" class=\"local\">'Alternative fasciotomy techniques for elective compartment decompression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following surgical decompression, fasciotomy wounds are left open, dressed with moist saline-soaked gauze and lightly wrapped to maintain the dressings in place. Skin closure is delayed to allow frequent wound inspection and interval muscle debridement, as needed. (See <a href=\"#H548658796\" class=\"local\">'Wound management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications related to fasciotomy for acute compartment syndrome are most commonly a direct result of tissue ischemia caused by the increased intra-compartment pressure. A delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute compartment syndrome significantly increases morbidity and mortality following fasciotomy. (See <a href=\"#H548658803\" class=\"local\">'Technical complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H548658810\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical complications including incomplete fasciotomy necessitating a return to the operating room, nerve injury and muscle devascularization can be minimized with meticulous surgical techniques. (See <a href=\"#H548658803\" class=\"local\">'Technical complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Velmahos GC, Theodorou D, Demetriades D, et al.
