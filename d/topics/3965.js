The major limitations to survival in the early post-transplant period (first six months) are nonspecific graft failure, acute rejection, and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV, also called transplant coronary artery disease or cardiac transplant vasculopathy) is among the top three causes of death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis after cardiac transplantation&quot;, section on 'Causes of death'</a>.)</p><p>Ischemic consequences of CAV include graft failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death. CAV may cause myocardial infarction, but because of cardiac denervation, it only rarely causes angina pectoris. </p><p>The epidemiology, approach, and outcomes of the diagnosis of transplant vasculopathy will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, risk factors for, prevention, and treatment of transplant vasculopathy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-and-risk-factors-for-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of and risk factors for cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12357181\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence and prognosis of CAV after cardiac transplantation vary considerably depending on how vasculopathy is defined and which method is used to detect it. Some studies have defined CAV as coronary artery stenosis ranging from 30 to 70 percent by coronary angiography. Other studies have diagnosed CAV using the much more sensitive technique of intravascular ultrasound. </p><p>To resolve the problem of disparate definitions of CAV, guidelines for terminology related to CAV were published by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A grading system based on conventional invasive coronary angiographic findings and graft function (evaluated by echocardiography or invasive hemodynamic data) was established (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70548\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70548 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12357188\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 2017 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) registry report on data from more than 135,000 heart transplant recipients, the overall prevalence of CAV in survivors at 1, 5, and 10 years after transplantation was 8, 29, and 47 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence of CAV has decreased slightly, but significantly, over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and the importance of CAV as cause of death late after transplantation has decreased over the last decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the ISHLT registry, important predictors of development of CAV were older donor age, a donor history of hypertension, younger recipient age, greater numbers of HLA-DR mismatches, and recipient pretransplant diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. </p><p>Additional data come from an analysis of donor factors predicting CAV in 39,704 heart transplant recipients from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The prevalence of CAV at five years was somewhat lower than in the ISHLT registry at 23 percent. In the UNOS population, donor factors including older age, a history of hypertension, male gender, white ethnicity, tobacco use, diabetes, and weight &ge;85 kg predicted early development of vasculopathy.</p><p>However, the studies mentioned above do not address the severity of CAV. The frequency of clinically important disease was examined in a multicenter analysis of CAV performed by the Cardiac Transplant Research Database, which evaluated 4637 angiograms in 2609 patients transplanted between 1990 and 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At five years, some angiographic evidence of coronary disease was present in 42 percent of patients. However, only 7 percent had severe coronary disease, which was defined as left main coronary artery stenosis &gt;70 percent, stenosis of two or more primary coronary arteries &gt;70 percent, or branch stenosis in all three systems &gt;70 percent. </p><p>CAV typically progresses slowly. However, patients occasionally progress rapidly and unpredictably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. In a matter of months, the angiographic picture can change from a relatively benign appearance to a diffuse, occlusive pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F106972\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106972 \">image 1</a>). Such rapid progression can be associated with the occurrence of late antibody-mediated rejection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Acute antibody-mediated (humoral) rejection'</a>). A lower incidence of CAV (22 percent) has been observed in patients who survive more than 10 years, suggesting that late onset CAV is infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], although this conclusion is controversial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22915064\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22915071\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early detection of CAV is challenging because symptoms of myocardial ischemia secondary to CAV are typically absent or atypical due to afferent and efferent allograft denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although there is evidence for reinnervation in some patients by five years after transplantation, the degree of reinnervation is generally incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. As a result, patients with CAV seldom experience classic angina pectoris. Premonitory symptoms associated with exertion such as chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, gastrointestinal distress, presyncope, or syncope are often missing or atypical, so symptoms do not provide a reliable warning of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This was illustrated by a study of 22 cardiac transplant recipients with 25 acute myocardial infarctions at a mean of 3.9 years after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The most common symptoms were weakness (16), dyspnea (11), and palpitations (eight); only two patients had chest pain, three patients had arm pain, and three patients had no symptoms. </p><p>Since early symptoms may be subtle or absent, symptoms and signs of progressive heart failure due to allograft dysfunction, silent myocardial infarction detected on testing (as discussed below), or sudden death are common initial clinical presentations of CAV. CAV may also present with asymptomatic changes in allograft function detected on routine imaging studies (eg, echocardiography) or right heart catheterization. </p><p>Thus, if outcomes are to be improved by early diagnosis, CAV must be detected by screening studies rather than by waiting for the onset of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12914951\"><span class=\"h2\">Test findings</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2459357834\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, CAV may present with silent myocardial infarction detected on electrocardiogram or cardiac imaging (eg, regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram). However, the electrocardiogram is usually of limited value in assessing myocardial ischemia in cardiac transplant recipients given the high prevalence of electrocardiographic abnormalities in this population, including Q waves, ST elevation or depression, and T wave inversions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1017665263\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and stress testing in diagnosis of CAV is described below.

Coronary angiography is also indicated in cardiac transplant recipients presenting with symptoms suggesting angina, although such symptoms are infrequent due to cardiac denervation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is suggested when angiographic findings seem insufficient to explain graft dysfunction or anginal symptoms. Due to the concentric nature of the stenoses associated with transplant vasculopathy, coronary angiography can severely underestimate the presence and burden of this process. IVUS and coronary flow reserve (CFR) measurements overcome this limitation of routine coronary angiography. (See <a href=\"#H21505607\" class=\"local\">'Intravascular ultrasound'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21504280\" class=\"local\">'Coronary flow reserve'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12357209\"><span class=\"h3\">Coronary angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As advocated in the 2010 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) consensus statement, invasive coronary angiography is the standard method for surveillance and monitoring of transplant vasculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/2,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16</a>] and is used in most transplant centers, though it lacks sensitivity for early stage CAV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Baseline coronary angiography is commonly performed a few weeks after transplantation, unless the donor underwent catheterization as part of the evaluation of the suitability of the organ, and at most centers it is performed annually or biannually starting at one year postoperatively. Noninvasive studies have not proven to be sufficiently sensitive to replace coronary angiography in the early years after cardiac transplantation, although they may serve a useful adjunctive role in detecting myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Coronary angiography enables identification of coronary luminal narrowing and lesion type, as well as assessment of the rate of contrast filling of the coronary arteries. A standardized description of lesion type was developed and subsequently adopted generally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69520\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69520 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The description is useful for communicating angiography results in heart transplant recipients, but the classification has not been shown to be of prognostic value. The rate of contrast filling of the coronary arteries provides an important clue for detecting small vessel and distal disease, although methods to quantitate filling rate are somewhat subjective. (See <a href=\"#H21505027\" class=\"local\">'TIMI frame count'</a> below.)</p><p>Although coronary angiography is the clinical gold standard for the diagnosis of nontransplant coronary artery disease, it is less sensitive in detecting transplant vasculopathy, as acknowledged in the ISHLT consensus document [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/2,6,9,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,9,20,21</a>]. The lower sensitivity of angiography for CAV is due to the often diffuse, longitudinal, and concentric nature of the disease, as opposed to the focal and eccentric pattern of nontransplant atherosclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51137\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51137 \">figure 2</a>). As a result, many patients who develop clinical events that are presumably due to transplant vasculopathy do not have angiographically significant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Since transplant vasculopathy is a diffuse process, angiographic diagnosis of CAV is often more difficult than for nontransplant coronary atherosclerotic lesions and interobserver variation of angiographic diagnoses of coronary vasculopathy is large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Angiograms performed to screen for allograft vasculopathy should be reviewed by investigators with particular experience in the field. </p><p>Although coronary angiography has relatively low sensitivity for CAV, the presence of angiographic disease has been shown to be prognostically significant. For example, a study of 91 patients found that absence of angiographic coronary disease was a significant predictor of survival without adverse cardiac events at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The role of preventive therapy in patients at risk for contrast nephropathy (particularly diabetic patients with renal dysfunction) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of contrast nephropathy associated with angiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21505607\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravascular ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IVUS is suggested when angiographic findings seem insufficient to explain left ventricular dysfunction. IVUS is helpful to confirm the diagnosis of CAV, but its use is limited by technical issues, risk of complications, limited availability of expertise, and cost. IVUS with or without quantitative coronary angiography has been adopted by several cardiac transplant centers as the diagnostic approach of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p>In clinical practice (outside of a research setting), IVUS is used mainly in two settings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some centers perform an IVUS exam early after transplantation (typically at the one-year mark) and risk stratify patients based on the findings. Other centers perform IVUS both a few weeks after transplantation and after one year, thus enabling discrimination between donor-transmitted disease and true transplant vasculopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IVUS is performed in patients with graft failure, when endomyocardial biopsy lacks clear signs of rejection and conventional angiography does not show evidence of CAV. In these cases, demonstration of significant intimal thickening on IVUS is required to confirm a diagnosis of CAV.</p><p/><p>Clear consensus on the diagnostic criteria for CAV using IVUS has not been reached, and several measures of changes to the coronary vessel wall (maximal intimal thickness, percent atheroma volume, total atheroma volume) can be obtained by IVUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, most apply the criterion used in clinical trials, which is an increase in maximal intimal thickness &ge;0.5 mm in the left ascending anterior (LAD) branch from the time of transplantation to one year after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. If the patient is examined later or no baseline exam has been performed, detection of a maximal intimal thickness &ge;0.5 mm in LAD would be considered diagnostic of CAV.</p><p>Technical issues for IVUS include catheter size, which limits imaging of distal small caliber vessels, and the need for multivessel imaging to optimize the sensitivity of the study. </p><p>In experienced hands, the risk associated with IVUS in transplant recipients is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This risk of complications with multivessel IVUS has been reported as 1.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, the exam is time consuming and adds significantly to cost. Consequently, as noted in the ISHLT consensus statement, IVUS is not recommended for routine surveillance outside of clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition to its value in research, IVUS may be of clinical value in identifying the cause of unexplained graft failure (ie, ventricular dysfunction in the absence of rejection) in selected patients with normal coronary arteriography.</p><p>Since the intimal and medial layers of the arterial wall have differing acoustic densities, IVUS can distinguish these layers and thereby detect abnormal thickening of the intima. IVUS detects intimal thickening in more than 80 percent of patients as early as one year after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. The most rapid rate of intimal thickening occurs in the first year after transplantation, followed by a slower rate of thickening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Since CAV is frequently diffuse and circumferential, many patients with moderate to severe intimal thickening on IVUS, including those who develop clinical events, do not have significant visible disease on coronary angiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65796%7ECARD%2F77518\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef65796 graphicRef77518 \">movie 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>In proximal segments of the coronary arteries, the intimal thickening is primarily focal and eccentric, similar to the pattern seen in native coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. By comparison, intimal thickening in mid and distal segments is more commonly diffuse and circumferential. This suggests at least two etiologies for the vascular lesions: proximal disease that may be donor-transmitted and distal disease that may be the result of acquired immune-mediated vessel injury exacerbated by significant metabolic perturbations that occur after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>]. The only possible way to distinguish between donor transmitted disease and de-novo allograft vasculopathy is by performing serial IVUS studies starting with a baseline measurement early postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Abnormalities detected by IVUS are predictive of cardiac events and death as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an early study, the presence of severe intimal thickening (&gt;0.5 mm) detected by IVUS predicted subsequent adverse cardiac events, which often occurred in patients with normal coronary angiograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IVUS evidence of progression of CAV during the first year after transplantation is a predictor of adverse events as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a multicenter study of 125 patients, the change in maximal intimal thickness (MIT) from baseline to one year was compared at several matched sites in the same coronary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. An increase in MIT of &ge;0.5 mm was present in 24 patients (19 percent). At five-year follow-up, these 24 patients had more frequent death or graft loss (20.8 versus 5.9 percent in those with an MIT increase &lt;0.5 mm); nonfatal major adverse cardiac events, death, or graft loss (45.8 versus 16.8 percent); and newly occurring angiographic luminal irregularities (65.2 versus 32.6 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Similar findings were noted in a series of 143 patients in which MIT on IVUS was measured at baseline and one year; rapidly progressive vasculopathy was again defined as an increase in MIT of &ge;0.5 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The TIMI frame count, which is the number of cine frames required for dye to reach standardized distal coronary landmarks during coronary angiography, is a simple and reproducible method for identifying a decrease in rate of coronary blood flow on routine angiograms. Worsening microvascular function signified by increasing TIMI frame count may or may not correlate with progression of epicardial disease. In a study of 42 cardiac transplant recipients followed for five years, an increase in the TIMI frame count was observed in those who developed angiographic evidence of transplant atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Identification of microvascular CAV is not relied on in routine clinical practice but gives supplementary information when evaluating patients for CAV, especially those with new graft dysfunction or arrhythmia. In these patients, an endomyocardial biopsy is obtained to detect acute cellular rejection, and hence information on CAV as a possible cause (when acute cellular rejection is ruled out) can be obtained &quot;for free&quot; using the biopsy specimen. However, the sensitivity of a histopathologic diagnosis of allograft vasculopathy using angiography or IVUS as a gold standard is low, probably because of the low probability of biopsies containing microvasculature.</p><p>When documented, microvasculopathy may have prognostic importance. In a report from a single-center study, stenosis of the coronary microvasculature was evaluated on histologic examination of routine post-transplant endomyocardial biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In biopsies harvested from 873 patients during the first post-transplantation year, stenotic microvasculopathy was detected in 43 percent of biopsies and was predominantly due to medial disease. Stenotic microvasculopathy was associated with reduced overall survival (10.9 versus 13.4 years) and decreased freedom from fatal cardiac events (96 versus 99 percent, 87 versus 97 percent, and 76 versus 90 percent at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively).</p><p>In this study, the occurrence of microvasculopathy was independent of the existence of epicardial transplant vasculopathy.

It has been postulated that microvasculopathy may represent a sensitive marker for the risk of developing transplant vasculopathy, and thus is a potential surrogate end point in future prevention trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

CCTA is an attractive potential screening tool because it allows for direct visualization of the coronary arteries with less associated patient discomfort, risk, and cost than conventional angiography. It is used in patients with preserved renal function but in whom conventional angiography is considered high risk, for instance due to peripheral vascular disease, and who are poor candidates for stress echocardiography, for instance because of low image quality. Guidelines do not recommend CCTA as a standard noninvasive tool for routine monitoring allograft vasculopathy, but with technical developments improving image quality and reducing radiation and dye requirements, CCTA will likely be used in selected patients in the future.</p><p>A summary of study results thus far is provided in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54030 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/55-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-64</a>]. The reported sensitivity of CCTA for CAV has improved with improving CT technology, ranging from 85 to 100 percent at the patient level in various studies. A meta-analysis reported that sensitivity and specificity of 64-slice CCTA (n = 241 patients) using coronary angiography as a gold standard was 97 and 92 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Detection of distal and small vessel disease using CCTA remains an issue to some extent. In addition, a proportion of patients have been excluded from the studies because of poor image quality, tachycardia, or renal insufficiency. While most studies have reported a high negative-predictive value, the relation of CCTA findings to long-term prognosis is unclear. </p><p>Although multislice CCTA is noninvasive, it adds to the burden of radiation already imposed on heart transplant recipients by repeated biopsies requiring fluoroscopy. CCTA also requires use of significantly greater amounts of iodine containing dye than conventional angiography, thus increasing the risk of nephrotoxicity. </p><p>Current guidelines do not recommend CCTA as a standard noninvasive tool for routine monitoring of allograft vasculopathy, but as technical developments improve image quality and reduce radiation and dye requirements, CCTA may become the screening method of choice.
