Common causes of PIH include acne vulgaris, eczematous dermatoses, and burn injury. PIH is a frustrating problem that can have a strong psychological toll on affected patients. </p><p>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of PIH will be reviewed here. Other causes of cutaneous hyperpigmentation are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-hyperpigmentation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired hyperpigmentation disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H382268043\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PIH is a common disorder that can occur at any age and has an equivalent incidence in males and females. Although PIH may occur regardless of skin color, risk for clinically significant PIH increases with darkening skin pigmentation.</p><p>Skin phototype, a measure defined by the self-reported tendency to sunburn or tan after sun exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>), correlates with skin pigmentation and is useful for stratifying risk for PIH. Compared with individuals with skin phototype I or II, individuals with skin phototypes III to VI are more likely to develop PIH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548473785\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The provoking inflammatory process that leads to PIH can be endogenous or exogenous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Common endogenous causes of PIH include acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and lichen planus. Accidental burns, non-ionizing radiation therapy, phototoxicity, chemical peels, and laser procedures are examples of exogenous causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of PIH result from the presence of excess melanin or an abnormal distribution of melanin in the epidermis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dermis. Epidermal melanosis is proposed to result from effects of the release and oxidation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and leukotrienes or the effects of other inflammatory mediators in inflamed skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Inflammatory mediators may stimulate melanocytes to increase production of melanin and transfer melanin to surrounding keratinocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Dermal melanosis, also referred to as pigmentary incontinence, may occur when inflammation leads to a disruption of the basal layer of the epidermis, causing the release of melanin into the papillary dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F100569\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100569 \">picture 2</a>). Macrophages in the papillary dermis then phagocytize the released melanin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Alternatively, macrophages may enter the epidermis, phagocytize epidermal melanosomes, and return to the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Macrophages that have phagocytized melanin are often called &quot;melanophages.&quot; Melanin may remain in dermal macrophages for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-hyperpigmentation-disorders#H804774\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired hyperpigmentation disorders&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology of hyperpigmentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-inherited-hyperpigmentation-disorders#H2664884664\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and inherited hyperpigmentation disorders&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology of skin pigmentation'</a>.)</p><p>The increased risk for PIH in individuals with dark skin color may be related to the greater amount of epidermal melanin present in melanosomes in the epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some authors have also proposed that interindividual differences in the manner in which melanocytes respond to inflammation influence risk for PIH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548473791\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PIH manifests as hyperpigmented macules or patches on the skin. The configuration varies widely, matching the distribution of the preceding inflammatory dermatosis or injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58817%7EDERM%2F98492%7EDERM%2F64525%7EDERM%2F73678%7EDERM%2F100567%7EDERM%2F59590%7EDERM%2F83771%7EDERM%2F94241%7EDERM%2F55043\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58817 graphicRef98492 graphicRef64525 graphicRef73678 graphicRef100567 graphicRef59590 graphicRef83771 graphicRef94241 graphicRef55043 \">picture 1A-I</a>). Involvement may be limited, widespread, sharply circumscribed, or diffuse with ill-defined borders. Patients in whom PIH accompanies an active inflammatory process may demonstrate hyperpigmentation within chronically inflamed papules, plaques, or nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58067%7EDERM%2F98332%7EDERM%2F59258%7EDERM%2F66097\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58067 graphicRef98332 graphicRef59258 graphicRef66097 \">picture 3A-D</a>). In patients without an ongoing inflammatory process, PIH is asymptomatic.</p><p>The color of PIH depends on the position of excess pigment within the skin. PIH tends to appear as tan to dark brown when excess pigment is within the epidermis. In contrast, excess pigment in the dermis tends to manifest with a dark gray or blue-gray appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29008547\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histopathologic examination of PIH shows increased melanin in epidermal keratinocytes in specimens with epidermal melanosis and melanin deposition within dermal macrophages (melanophages) in specimens with dermal melanosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F100569\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100569 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].&nbsp;A Fontana-Masson silver stain can identify melanin. Occasional perivascular lymphocytes may be present in the superficial dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548473797\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PIH is typically a clinical diagnosis. The disorder should be strongly considered in patients who present macular or patchy hyperpigmentation and a history of a preceding inflammatory condition or a previous injury to the skin. A biopsy of the skin usually is not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29008576\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Questioning the patient about a preceding inflammatory skin disorder or accidental or iatrogenic skin injury elicits helpful information for diagnosis. Knowledge of the inciting factor also aids in the identification and treatment of an underlying condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29008535\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic clinical finding of macular or patchy tan, dark brown, gray, or blue-gray skin discoloration suggests PIH. Close attention should be paid to the shape and distribution of hyperpigmentation. The findings should correlate with the presumed cause. For example, multiple circular hyperpigmented macules on the face, chest, or back frequently represent PIH secondary to acne vulgaris (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58817%7EDERM%2F98492\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58817 graphicRef98492 \">picture 1A-B</a>). In contrast, a symmetrical eruption of irregular, hyperpigmented patches involving forehead, cheeks, and chin without preceding inflammation suggests a diagnosis of melasma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64109%7EDERM%2F75884\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64109 graphicRef75884 \">picture 4A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H548473804\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A full skin examination may help to identify the cause of PIH in patients with an underlying inflammatory dermatosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29012439\"><span class=\"h2\">Wood's lamp examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some patients with PIH, examination with a Wood's lamp can distinguish primarily epidermal melanosis from primarily dermal melanosis. In patients with skin phototypes I to IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60541\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541 \">table 1</a>), epidermal melanosis often manifests as well-circumscribed pigmentation with accentuated borders. In contrast, dermal melanosis typically appears poorly circumscribed and is not accentuated under Wood's lamp illumination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The Wood's lamp exam is not very effective for making this distinction in darkly pigmented patients (skin phototype VI) and has limited effectiveness for skin phototype V patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29008541\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A skin biopsy typically is not necessary for the diagnosis of PIH. Occasionally, a skin biopsy is performed to determine whether there is another cause of hyperpigmentation. In patients with an active inflammatory dermatosis, a skin biopsy may be helpful for confirming the underlying dermatosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548473804\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inciting factor for postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is often clear, leading to relative certainty of the diagnosis. The possibility of other disorders should be considered in patients with hyperpigmentation of unclear cause. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Melasma </strong>&ndash; Melasma is a common disorder that manifests with a symmetrical eruption of irregular hyperpigmented patches on sun-exposed skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64109%7EDERM%2F75884\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64109 graphicRef75884 \">picture 4A-B</a>). In most patients, melasma affects the face, particularly the forehead, malar areas, and chin. Melasma most frequently occurs in reproductive-age women.

The upper back is the most common location for macular amyloidosis. The extensor surfaces of the extremities are other common locations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-hyperpigmentation-disorders#H312764203\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired hyperpigmentation disorders&quot;, section on 'Primary cutaneous amyloidosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug-induced hyperpigmentation </strong>&ndash; Drug-induced hyperpigmentation represents the occurrence of a drug-stimulated increase in melanin production or deposition of drug complexes or metals in the dermis.

Erythema dyschromicum perstans is most frequently diagnosed in young adults of Latin-American origin. Early areas may have a thin, raised erythematous border. The trunk is the most common site for involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-hyperpigmentation-disorders#H264889637\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired hyperpigmentation disorders&quot;, section on 'Erythema dyschromicum perstans'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lichen planus pigmentosus </strong>&ndash; Lichen planus pigmentosus is a rare form of lichen planus that presents with oval or irregular brown to gray-brown macules and patches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F94397\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94397 \">picture 8</a>). Sun-exposed skin of the face and neck is a common site. Intertriginous involvement may also occur. Individuals with origin in India, Latin America, and the Middle East are most likely to develop this condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-hyperpigmentation-disorders#H312763791\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired hyperpigmentation disorders&quot;, section on 'Lichen planus pigmentosus'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Common additional causes of hyperpigmentation include lentigines (circumscribed, brown macules or patches in sun-exposed areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F61452%7EDERM%2F81287\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61452 graphicRef81287 \">picture 9A-B</a>)) and tinea versicolor (hyperpigmented macules and patches with fine scale on the trunk or proximal extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F100022\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100022 \">picture 10</a>)).

Topical interventions are the mainstay of medical treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29010787\"><span class=\"h2\">Essential measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photoprotection should be implemented in <strong>all </strong>patients treated for PIH. Potential exacerbating factors should also be eliminated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H548473826\"><span class=\"h3\">Photoprotection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Photoprotection reduces the risk for additional ultraviolet radiation-induced darkening of affected skin and may allow for the best results of treatment. Therefore, sun-protective measures are crucial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients should be instructed to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 to the entire affected area daily. Sunscreen should be reapplied every two hours during periods of sun exposure.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-sunscreen-and-sun-protective-measures#H9546141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of sunscreen and sun-protective measures&quot;, section on 'Photoprotective clothing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29012549\"><span class=\"h3\">Elimination of exacerbating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical treatment of PIH is often challenging. Therefore, the prevention of new areas of skin involvement through treatment of an active underlying cause, if present, is an essential component of management. For example, in patients with acne vulgaris-associated PIH, treatment of PIH should <strong>not</strong> be performed without treatment of active acne. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acne-vulgaris\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acne vulgaris&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, other factors that may exacerbate PIH should be eliminated. Patients should avoid scratching, rubbing, manipulating, or traumatizing the affected area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Exposure to furocoumarins and medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a> and tetracyclines may also increase PIH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Therefore, medical treatment is <strong>not</strong> necessary for all patients. Medical therapy can be limited to patients who desire accelerated resolution of hyperpigmentation. (See <a href=\"#H504983\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The location of hyperpigmentation within the skin may influence the likelihood of a good response to treatment. The interventions available for hyperpigmentation primarily reduce the production or distribution of epidermal pigment. Therefore, patients in whom hyperpigmentation primarily results from the presence of melanin within dermal macrophages are less likely to respond well to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Performance of a Wood's lamp examination prior to treatment can help to guide clinicians and patients regarding expectations for the results of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H29012439\" class=\"local\">'Wood's lamp examination'</a> above.) </p><p>Many treatments for PIH have skin irritation as a potential side effect.

Hydroquinone is less effective for hyperpigmentation in which pigment deposition is primarily in the dermal melanophages, as these cells have minimal or absent tyrosinase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Other potential mechanisms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> activity include inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis, selective cytotoxicity toward melanocytes, and melanosome degradation by autoxidation and phenol oxidases leading to highly reactive oxygen radicals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>].

Evidence for efficacy for hyperpigmentation primarily stems from studies of patients with melasma, another common disorder characterized by hyperpigmentation. As an example, hydroquinone was effective for melasma in a trial in which 48 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with twice-daily application of hydroquinone 4% cream and daily sunscreen or sunscreen alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. After 12 weeks of treatment, 40 percent of patients receiving hydroquinone had complete resolution of hyperpigmentation versus only 10 percent in the placebo group.

Most studies evaluating hydroquinone in PIH are uncontrolled, include other diagnoses, or evaluate hydroquinone combined with other therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. As an example, a 12-week open-label study that evaluated twice-daily application of a product containing microencapsulated hydroquinone 4%, retinol 0.15%, and antioxidants in 17 patients with mild to moderate PIH and 4 patients with melasma found at least 75 percent improvement or complete improvement of hyperpigmentation in 12 of the 19 patients who completed the study (63 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In patients in whom hyperpigmentation affects a very small portion of the affected body site (ie, a few hyperpigmented macules on the face), treatment is often limited to the specific areas of hyperpigmentation. However, the patient should be warned of the risk for the development of a temporary &quot;halo&quot; of hypopigmentation at the periphery of the treated areas. The halo may take several months to resolve after treatment is discontinued.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Improvement from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> therapy is often evident within several weeks to a few months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. We typically reassess patients after 12 weeks. If PIH is improved, treatment may be discontinued or continued for up to an additional 12 weeks in patients with a partial response. Maximum efficacy occurs around 20 weeks of treatment and efficacy plateaus after around 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The patient should apply a very thin layer of the retinoid to the entire affected area. For patients undergoing treatment for facial hyperpigmentation, the tretinoin is applied to the entire face. Clinically significant improvement may take a few months to achieve. There is not a limit to the duration of topical retinoid use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Irritant dermatitis is a common adverse effect of topical retinoids, particularly early in the course of therapy. In patients with darker skin phototypes, this is of particular concern because irritation may contribute to the development of additional PIH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postinflammatory-hyperpigmentation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The inclusion of a corticosteroid reduces risk for irritant dermatitis, a common adverse effect of both hydroquinone and tretinoin.

As with other skin-lightening therapies for PIH, the entire region of involvement (eg, entire face) should be treated to avoid inducing a negative cosmetic effect from irregular skin pigmentation.
