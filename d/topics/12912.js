The majority of these tumors arise in the maxillary sinuses, and most of the remainder start in the ethmoid sinuses. Cancers of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are extremely rare. Paranasal sinus cancers are more frequent in males than in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Factors associated with paranasal sinus cancers include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupational exposures &ndash; Including leather, textile, wood dust, and formaldehyde.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air pollution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tobacco smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viruses &ndash; Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been associated with paranasal sinus cancer, with some evidence suggesting that it may be involved in the malignant degeneration of inverted papilloma of the paranasal sinus, a rare, usually benign condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Correlations have also been suggested between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and sinonasal tract lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-half of paranasal malignancies are squamous cell carcinomas, and most of the remainder are adenoid cystic carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, or mucoepidermoid carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. A wide range of other tumors can originate in this region, including undifferentiated carcinoma, angiosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, lymphomas, olfactory neuroblastomas (esthesioneuroblastomas), melanomas, and meningiomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of head and neck neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paranasal sinus malignancies tend to be asymptomatic or have nonspecific sinonasal symptoms that may mimic benign disease until they invade adjacent structures. Thus, most patients have advanced disease by the time the diagnosis is established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>].</p><p>The most common symptoms include facial or dental pain, nasal obstruction, and epistaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. When symptoms of persistent nasal discharge and epistaxis occur in patients over age 40, cancer of the paranasal sinuses, nasal vestibule, or nasopharynx should be included in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-diagnosis-of-nasopharyngeal-carcinoma#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.) </p><p>Less common symptoms include cranial neuropathy (especially abnormalities of extraocular movements or trigeminal hypesthesia), chronic sinusitis, facial edema, vision loss, headache, rhinorrhea, and hyposmia. A classic triad of facial asymmetry, <span class=\"nowrap\">palpable/visible</span> tumor in the oral cavity, and visible intranasal tumor occurs in 40 to 60 percent of patients with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Symptoms and signs depend upon the involved site and extent of disease. The bony structures between the nasal cavity, sinuses, orbits, and cranial vaults are thin and offer little resistance to cancer spread.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the ethmoid sinus, locally advanced lesions may extend into the anterior cranial fossa via the cribriform plate or into the orbit through the lamina papyracea. This may result in anosmia or displacement (typically upward <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> outward) of the globe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the sphenoid sinus, disease may directly extend through the lateral bony wall into the cavernous sinus where cranial nerves III, IV, VI, V1, and V2 travel. It may also invade the middle cranial fossa directly or via the infraorbital nerve. Affected patients may complain of diplopia, blurred vision, proptosis, paresthesias in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, or trismus if the pterygoid musculature is invaded. Inferior extension into the oral cavity may also cause painful loose teeth.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206904222\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a paranasal sinus malignancy requires tissue for histologic evaluation and the identification of the paranasal sinus as the site of tumor origin. If a paranasal lesion is suspected, the history and physical examination should include close attention to the&nbsp;signs&nbsp;and symptoms (such as cranial nerve involvement) due to orbital extension or base of skull&nbsp;involvement.</p><p>The limited anatomic access of the paranasal sinuses makes early diagnosis difficult. Endoscopic examination is generally necessary to obtain a biopsy for tissue diagnosis and to assess the extent of local disease, unless there is tumor protruding into the nasal or oral cavity.</p><p>Lesions involving the maxillary sinus can be biopsied intranasally or through the gingivobuccal sulcus if the tumor extends through the anterior maxilla. Adequate examination and biopsy may require general anesthesia. Ethmoid sinus lesions are biopsied through an endoscopic or transnasal approach in the operating room, as are frontal sinus malignancies via the frontal recess. Frontal sinus trephination is rarely necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206904215\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies provide important information for staging and treatment planning. Typically, both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed and are complementary in evaluating disease extent and in distinguishing tumor from infection, retained secretions, and granulation of scar tissue. CT offers superior definition of bone and bone invasion, while MRI gives superior soft tissue delineation and allows for visualization of cranial nerves, especially when they are involved with disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>The eighth (2017) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) defines separate T staging for tumors of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110768 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There is no standard staging system for frontal or sphenoid sinus tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regional lymph node metastases are uncommon with early stage disease that is confined to the sinuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The retropharyngeal nodes comprise the first echelon of lymphatic drainage for sinus malignancies. Other regional nodes that are commonly involved are the periparotid, level 1B, and level 2 nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54099\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54099 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The incidence of lymph node involvement increases as tumors extend locally to adjacent sites, especially with extension into the oral cavity. Interestingly, one large series found higher rates of cervical lymph node involvement with T2 rather than T3 or T4 tumors of squamous cell histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This finding is due to the unique staging of maxillary sinus cancer, where T2 lesions are those that extend into the hard palate or nasal cavity. These areas have a richer lymphatic plexus and act more like oral cavity cancers, with a higher rate of occult metastases.</p><p>Distant metastases are uncommon at presentation. The lung, liver, and bone are the sites most frequently involved when distant metastases occur after treatment or are present at diagnosis. Chest imaging with CT can be considered clinically indicated, while positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> should be considered for stage III or IV disease at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/11,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA AND ADENOCARCINOMA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262658880\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach to management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials that define the optimal treatment for paranasal cancers because of the rarity of these tumors and because of their heterogeneity in both histology and site of origin. The available data are derived from single-institution, observational series. The approach described here is consistent with guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Paranasal sinus cancers generally invade locally early in their natural history and have a high tendency for local recurrence. Local recurrence rates following resection are high in the absence of postoperative radiation therapy (RT), even when the original resection is thought to have been complete.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with early (stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II)</span> disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110768\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110768 \">table 1</a>), complete surgical resection is the initial step in management. Postoperative RT is indicated for those who are at increased risk of local recurrence (eg, positive or uncertain surgical margins, unfavorable histology, perineural invasion). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6296085\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with locally advanced (stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV)</span> disease, initial surgical resection is preferred as the initial therapy. Postoperative adjuvant RT is indicated because of the high risk of local recurrence.

Advances in surgical techniques have resulted in better functional reconstructions and improved quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and the decision of whether or not to operate depends upon the balance between survival, morbidity, and function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6302814\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of the orbit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential to evaluate the extent of disease and orbital involvement and to plan the surgical approach. Tumor adjacent to the periorbita (the dense periosteum surrounding the globe) was the most sensitive predictor of orbital invasion for both CT and MRI in a small study of patients with advanced sinus malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. A European position paper on endoscopic management of paranasal sinus tumors suggested that orbital fat signal-suppressed (short tau inversion recovery [STIR]) images by MRI may improve detection of orbital fat infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Three stages of orbital invasion have been described: grade I, destruction of the medial orbital wall; grade II, invasion of the periorbital fat, extraconal; and grade III, invasion of the medial rectus, optic nerve, bulb, or eyelid skin, which implies breaching of the <span class=\"nowrap\">periorbita/periosteum</span>. Orbital exenteration has been advocated only for those patients who present with grade III invasion; however, frozen section at the time of surgery is often necessary to confirm whether or not tumor has transgressed the periosteum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Orbital exenteration does not improve survival for patients with advanced sinus malignancy that does not completely transgress the dense periorbita [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although recurrence in the orbit has been associated with poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>], most head and neck surgeons favor orbital preservation with periosteal resection in the case of incomplete periosteal invasion since this yields comparable survival and can maintain a functional eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/28,29,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,32-34</a>]. Orbital exenteration is indicated for gross transgression of the periorbita with orbital invasion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6302735\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advances in surgical technique have led to an increasing use of image-guided endoscopic approaches for the resection of sinonasal tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These techniques have largely replaced open approaches in many academic centers.</p><p>Image-guided endoscopic techniques are a multidisciplinary collaboration of otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons. They provide superior visualization, with angled endoscopes affording exposure around anatomic corners. The endoscopic method employs piecemeal tumor removal and was initially criticized for its inability to achieve an en bloc resection. Clear surgical margins (regardless of the surgical method) are a critical factor for tumor control, and both open and endoscopic techniques appear equally effective in this aspect. Endoscopic sinus surgery has been used both alone and in combination with open craniofacial surgery.</p><p>These endoscopic approaches may offer significant advantages in terms of a lower frequency of surgical complications and decreased morbidity. Advantages include lack of facial incisions, craniotomies, or facial bone osteotomies; decreased neurovascular structure manipulation; early tumor devascularization; access to deeply seated lesions; decreased hospital stay and pain; and faster recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Brain retraction is avoidable, so postoperative brain edema and possible encephalomalacia are circumvented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Nasal crusting can be a complication of both endoscopic and open approaches. This is related to disruption of the sinus mucosal lining as well as to postoperative radiation.</p><p>Endoscopic sinus surgery has also been utilized for palliation of symptoms (epistaxis, nasal obstruction, etc) in advanced sinonasal malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Contraindications to a pure endoscopic approach include tumors with extensive dural involvement or extension into facial or orbital soft tissues.</p><p>Several series that included patients with a variety of histologic tumor types have found that endoscopic techniques can be applied to patients with locally advanced lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Similar oncologic results have been documented in numerous studies compared with traditional open approaches, although there are no direct comparisons, and longer follow-up is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of surgical and prosthetic reconstruction is to replace the form and function of facial and anterior skull base defects caused by surgery. Advances in tissue transfer techniques (particularly microvascular free flaps) provide reconstructive options in addition to maxillofacial prostheses. Optimal esthetic, functional, and quality of life outcomes are superior with combined approaches rather than single techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Key issues with the management of maxillectomy defects include reconstruction of the orbital floor in order to support globe position, reconstruction of the palatal surface to separate nasal contents and to provide framework for dental rehabilitation, and reestablishment of facial symmetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. For patients who have undergone orbital <span class=\"nowrap\">exenteration/clearance,</span> temporalis muscle or temporoparietalis flaps can be used to line the cavity.

A multi-institution analysis of 1193 patients who underwent open craniofacial resection observed postoperative mortality and complication rates of 5 and 36 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The risk of complications and mortality is increased substantially for patients older than 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>State-of-the-art image-guided <span class=\"nowrap\">endoscopic/endonasal</span> approaches to skull base malignancies are associated with decreased postoperative morbidity and mortality. In a review of 800 patients, cerebrospinal fluid leak was the most common complication (16 percent). All but one patient was repaired endoscopically. The overall incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak in this series decreased significantly with the use of vascularized skull base reconstruction. Overall mortality was 0.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Another more recent study of 1000 patients who underwent endoscopic skull base surgery showed an overall infection rate of 1.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6296085\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paranasal sinus cancers have a high tendency for local recurrence in the absence of postoperative RT, even when the original resection was thought to be complete.

Charged particle irradiation (proton beam, carbon ion) may offer additional advantages for delivering maximal tumor doses while minimizing radiation to the retina and brain compared with photon-based therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paranasal-sinus-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, there are no prospective comparisons, and the data in these retrospective analyses often used older RT techniques.

For patients with positive tumor margins and for those that are unresectable, the prescribed doses are approximately 66 and 70 Gy, respectively, when given in 2 Gy fractions once daily. There are no randomized trials that define the dose of radiation in these patient populations, and these schedules are based upon more-extensive data from other head and neck cancers.
