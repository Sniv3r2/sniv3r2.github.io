This topic will discuss the indications, contraindications, preparation, equipment, and techniques needed to perform DL and ETI in adults. The use of more sophisticated airway equipment (eg, video laryngoscopes), approaches to airway management in specific clinical circumstances, pediatric laryngoscopy, and rapid sequence intubation are all reviewed separately.

In the perioperative setting, endotracheal tubes may be placed in many clinical circumstances, including patients receiving general anesthesia, surgery involving or adjacent to the airway, unconscious patients requiring airway protection, or surgery involving unusual positioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Less frequently, intubation is performed for short-term hyperventilation to manage increased intracranial pressure or to manage copious secretions or bleeding from the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few absolute contraindications to tracheal intubation. Most involve supraglottic or glottic pathology that precludes placement of an endotracheal tube (ETT) through the glottis or which may be exacerbated by insertion of the ETT or laryngoscope. As an example, blunt trauma to the larynx may cause a laryngeal fracture or disruption of the laryngotracheal junction. In such cases, traction from the laryngoscope blade or pressure from a stylet within an ETT could create a false lumen or complete a partial tear of the trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Penetrating trauma of the upper airway may also result in conditions exacerbated by laryngoscopy or ETT placement, such as a hematoma or partial transection of the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. When examination findings suggest such conditions exist, it may be safer to support oxygenation and ventilation using noninvasive means until a definitive airway can be established or to perform an immediate surgical airway, if necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-failed-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the failed airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other conditions associated with difficult intubation include severe laryngeal or supralaryngeal edema as a consequence of bacterial infection, burns, or anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In these cases, visualization of the laryngeal inlet during laryngoscopy may be impossible, and local trauma caused by the laryngoscope blade or attempts at ETT insertion can lead to increased swelling, rendering mask ventilation difficult or impossible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epiglottitis-supraglottitis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epiglottitis (supraglottitis): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Adults'</a>.)</p><p>Relative contraindications to tracheal intubation involve potential difficulties performing the procedure. Such difficulties may be related to anatomic features, injuries, physiologic status, or the skill set of the clinician. The identification of traits associated with difficult airway management is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When physical features suggest that direct laryngoscopy and intubation will be difficult or impossible, or the operator is not skilled in bag-mask ventilation and back-up surgical techniques (ie, cricothyrotomy), prudence dictates that noninvasive methods of airway support or an awake intubation be performed (rather than rapid sequence intubation) to avoid creating a life-threatening &quot;cannot intubate-cannot ventilate&quot; situation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several airway algorithms promulgated for anesthesiologists and emergency medicine physicians recommend that an airway assessment be conducted whenever possible before intubation is attempted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Whenever possible, the airway assessment should include examination of physical and historical features that have been shown to predict difficulty with airway management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94434 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94436 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94433\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94433 \">table 3</a>).

The epiglottis appears as a hood overlying the glottis, which lies deeper. The vallecula (valley) is the cleft between the base of the tongue and the epiglottis into which a curved laryngoscope blade is placed. The epiglottis is suspended from the hyoid bone by a midline ligament, the hyoepiglottic ligament (HEL). Pressure of the blade tip against the HEL elevates the epiglottis effectively and efficiently. This is in contrast to placing the blade tip into the vallecula on either side of the HEL, as classically recommended, which results in less efficient elevation of the epiglottis.</p><p>The walls of the vallecula are formed by the glossoepiglottic membrane, a midline fold of which covers the HEL. The space behind that membrane and anterior to the epiglottis is filled with loose areolar tissue back to the insertion of its stem on the anterior wall of the thyroid cartilage. More detailed coverage of airway anatomy is found separately.

Apneic oxygenation can be accomplished most simply with passive oxygen insufflation via nasal cannula at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span>.

Include ETTs one size larger and one size smaller than the ETT to be used initially.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The size of the ETT may vary based on the clinical situation. For short-term intubation during routine general anesthesia, we typically place a 7 to 7.5 mm internal diameter (ID) tube for women, and a 7.5 to 8 mm ID ETT for men. When the patient is likely to remain intubated in the intensive care unit, we place slightly larger ETTs, 7.5 to 8 mm ID for women and 8.0 to 8.5 mm ID for men. Smaller ETTs are associated with less post-intubation sore throat, are easier to place, and may cause less tissue trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. However, in the intensive care unit, a larger ETT facilitates tracheal suctioning and flexible bronchoscopy through the ETT, and may reduce airway resistance during weaning from mechanical ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In emergency situations, providing oxygen is critical and ETT size is a secondary concern. The largest size ETT that can be placed expeditiously should be used.

The stylet should be straight from the proximal end of the ETT to the proximal end of the ETT cuff, and should be bent no more than 35 degrees. More acute angles at the end of the ETT (eg, &quot;hockey stick&quot; conformation) may cause the tip to become stuck on the anterior trachea, preventing advancement (and possibly traumatizing the airway) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The blade of a laryngoscope is typically comprised of a flat element (spatula), a vertical element (flange), and a light source.</p><p>These basic parts have been combined in different configurations, of which the straight and curved blades are the most common. The Macintosh (curved) and the Miller (straight) are used most often (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72787\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72787 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80045\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80045 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The curved blade is designed to minimize stimulation of the posterior epiglottis, which is innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve. It is configured to approximate the curvature of the tongue. Its tip fits into the recess at the back of the tongue (vallecula) and elevates the epiglottis indirectly, most effectively by putting pressure on the hyoepiglottic ligament. Many clinicians prefer the curved blade for initial attempts at direct laryngoscopy (DL).</p><p>The straight blade is designed to be inserted beneath the epiglottis and then to lift it directly, thereby exposing the glottic aperture. The straight blade may offer advantages in particular circumstances, such as when the glottis is deep or anterior, upper incisors are prominent, or a long, floppy epiglottis obscures the glottis and must be lifted out of the line of sight.</p><p>The Miller blade has a sharply curved flange that provides a well-protected view of the glottis but excludes the tube as well as the tongue, and so requires a wider path to accept tube passage lateral to the blade. This can make insertion of the tracheal tube difficult. Some straight blade variants (eg, Phillips, Wisconsin, or Henderson) have a higher flange that allows tube passage via the lumen, although this approach obstructs the view of the glottis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80045\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80045 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Other blades have been described as useful in unusual or anatomically challenging situations, but peer-reviewed literature on the subject is limited (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72383 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75199\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75199 \">picture 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Blades of varying angles (along with short laryngoscope handles) may enable the clinician to insert the laryngoscope into the mouth of a patient with a large chest wall or soft tissue at the upper chest that impedes insertion of a standard blade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Modifications of the curved blade include the English version, which curves throughout its length and includes a less prominent flange that extends further toward the tip. In contrast, the standard American blade usually flattens in its midportion before curving again along the distal portion, while its flange tapers more proximally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The German version of the Macintosh blade is similar to the English in shape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The shorter flange of the German and English designs allows easier insertion into a mouth with large front teeth or restricted opening. This design may also reduce the tendency of novices to &quot;lever&quot; the blade against the upper teeth with the intention of improving a limited view of the larynx but which can break teeth. Curved blades with markedly shorter proximal flanges (eg, Callander-Thomas, Biarra-Guiffreda) are designed to reduce the impact of the blade on the front teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Another modification is the articulated blade. The McCoy blade and Flexiblade include an articulation controlled by a lever on the handle that allows the laryngoscopist to flex the end of the blade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Blade flexion may increase tension against the glossoepiglottic membrane when the blade tip is in the lateral vallecula, thereby improving the view of the glottis.

Thus, it is important to ensure adequate lighting during the procedure. In a survey of Philadelphia emergency departments, poor lighting among the available laryngoscopes was surprisingly common, with light intensity ranging from 11 to over 5000 lux, and a median of around 700 lux (lux is the SI unit of illumination; recommended lighting for detailed visual work is approximately 1000 to 2000 lux) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Varying the distance of the light source from the blade tip has several effects. Shorter distances increase brightness but increase the likelihood of shadowing on the larynx when the epiglottis cannot be fully elevated. A long &quot;floppy&quot; epiglottis can be elevated by pressure against the midline HEL, but such elevation may completely block the light (and video feed if present) when the light source is close to the blade tip.</p><p>Newer fiberoptic laryngoscopes tend to provide better illumination than incandescent bulb laryngoscopes. The quality of fiberoptic illumination varies substantially with the size of the fiberoptic bundles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], battery quality, whether rechargeable or standard, battery age, and whether the battery is fully charged. Over time, repeated sterilization may diminish the quality of light emitted by fiberoptic laryngoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

In these cases the cervical collar may be opened if needed, but an assistant must provide in-line head and neck stabilization during the procedure.</p><p>DL is best performed with a trained assistant. The assistant lifts the head and flexes the spine, allowing the laryngoscopist to preserve arm strength and perform fine motor movements. Although neck extension (as classically described in the &quot;sniffing&quot; position) may improve glottic exposure compared with a supine position with the patient's head laying flat, neck extension is usually counterproductive and should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Optimizing the view'</a> below.)</p><p>Bimanual laryngoscopy should be performed routinely. It involves moving the hyoid bone and <strong>thyroid</strong> cartilage (<strong>NOT</strong> the cricoid) with the right hand, helping to bring the glottis into view. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Bimanual laryngoscopy (external laryngeal manipulation)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be prepared for unanticipated difficulty.</p><p/><p>Prepare meticulously and perform laryngoscopy properly every time, even when no markers for difficult intubation are identified before the procedure. Simplified approaches work in easy cases, but the best patient care requires a carefully planned approach that includes habitual use of bimanual laryngoscopy, ready access to rescue airways, a back-up plan, and the capacity to provide a surgical airway, if necessary. Prepare as if every case is unpredictable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SpO2 should be monitored continuously during laryngoscopy. Patients are apneic during rapid sequence intubation and despite preoxygenation and apneic oxygenation, SpO2 will fall over time, sometimes precipitously depending on patient comorbidities and clinical circumstances. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once SpO2 drops below 90 percent, oxygen saturation falls rapidly. Therefore, in many cases &ndash; particularly with unstable patients &ndash; where the SpO2 has fallen to 90 percent and intubation remains incomplete, it is necessary to stop the procedure in order to raise the patient's oxygen saturation with bag mask ventilations using high flow oxygen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, no rules are absolute and clinicians must use their judgment about when it is necessary to halt the procedure to provide oxygen. As an example, this may not be necessary for stable patients in the operating room when an experienced clinician has a clear view of the larynx and the endotracheal tube (ETT) is on the verge of being successfully placed.</p><p/><p>Laryngoscopy and intubation occur in a stressful environment and require great concentration, especially in emergency situations. At times, the laryngoscopist may lose track of the duration of the patient's apnea during intubation attempts. Therefore, it is important that an assistant monitor the patient's oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) continuously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic steps for performing DL and tracheal intubation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain assistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepare equipment, monitors, and medications.

However, in the presence of potential cervical spine injury, head and neck manipulation must <strong>NOT</strong> be performed, and DL must be modified so as to protect against exacerbating any injury or traumatizing the spinal cord. In this setting, manual in-line stabilization should be used to minimize cervical spine motion, and the directions below about head and neck positioning do <strong>NOT</strong> apply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The classic &quot;sniffing&quot; position (atlanto-occipital extension with head elevation of 3 to 7 cm) is adequate for experts to intubate most patients, but further elevation almost always improves glottic exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. Initial positioning with the head elevated as high as necessary but not so high as to interfere with blade insertion, improves the laryngeal view and reduces the need for repositioning during intubation. Such positioning is especially important when intubation is anticipated to be difficult, including patients with hemodynamic instability, inadequate preoxygenation, morbid obesity, and abnormal airway anatomy (eg, recessed jaw, buck teeth, large tongue). An assistant strong enough to lift the patient's upper trunk and head should stand at the bedside to help with positioning, and to provide cricoid pressure when necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemodynamically stable patients with adequate preoxygenation generally tolerate the slightly prolonged apnea associated with additional head elevation maneuvers when they are well-planned and executed, but it is best to optimize positioning before attempting intubation. Should a second attempt at DL be necessary, bag-mask ventilation can be performed between attempts as needed.</p><p>A useful landmark for determining adequate head elevation is the alignment of the patient's ear (external auditory meatus) to the level of the sternal notch when seen from the side (sagittal view) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72755\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72755 \">picture 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F95285\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95285 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This positioning can be achieved by using linens or specially designed devices or beds to create a ramp.</p><p>The alignment achieved with this positioning reflects the forward displacement of the head relative to the thorax, which is achieved by flexing the spine, or more specifically the upper thoracic and <strong>lower</strong> cervical spine. Flexing the <strong>upper</strong> cervical spine moves the head toward the chest and increases resistance to tongue displacement, thereby increasing intubation difficulty. Tilting the head back by extending the atlanto-occipital joint is helpful, but extension of the cervical spine below the atlanto-occipital joint can compromise the glottic view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39</a>]. Arching of the neck away from the table surface indicates undesirable cervical extension, although visible arching is not a reliable way to determine the degree of extension. Flexing the bed at the hips does not change the relationship of the head relative to the thorax and does not by itself improve the view of the glottis.</p><p>Despite careful initial positioning, obtaining an adequate view of the larynx may require additional manipulation of the patient's head, neck, and glottis. Therefore, the patient's initial position should allow an assistant to elevate the patient's head and flex the lower neck further with ease. Ideally, an assistant performs any additional lifting of the head and flexion of the neck, allowing the laryngoscopist to maintain a view of the larynx and to concentrate on performing bimanual laryngoscopy to improve glottic exposure. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Optimizing the view'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Opening the mouth and inserting the blade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opening the patient's mouth and inserting the laryngoscope blade is usually not difficult. The scissor technique is an effective method for opening the mouth with one hand. To perform the technique, hold the tips of the thumb and middle finger of the right hand together, insert them between the upper and lower incisors, and &quot;scissor&quot; them past one another by flexing each digit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76790 \">picture 13</a>).</p><p>The mouth can also be opened by pushing the occiput down, towards the pillow, with the right hand, thereby extending the upper neck and making it possible to change the angle of blade insertion. In patients who are sedated and placed in a supine or slightly head-elevated position, this technique generally opens the mouth sufficiently to allow the blade to be inserted without the handle hitting the chest. Regardless of the method chosen, the blade is inserted in a controlled fashion to avoid injuring teeth or soft tissue.</p><p>Difficulty inserting the blade may occur for a number of reasons, including a small mouth, recessed mandible, prominent upper teeth, limited upper cervical spine or atlanto-occipital mobility, or a large chest wall that blocks insertion. Using a smaller blade (eg, Macintosh or Miller size 2), a smaller blade handle, or having an assistant retract the lip laterally may be helpful.</p><p>When insertion is prevented because the patient's chest is obstructing the laryngoscope handle, placing towels or blankets under the head and upper back to elevate the head relative to the chest is often helpful. Alternative approaches include rotating the laryngoscope blade for insertion and then rotating it back to the correct plane once it is in place, not snapping the attached blade handle open until after blade insertion, or inserting the laryngoscope blade without the handle and attaching it once the blade is in position. If available, a short laryngoscope handle or one which permits adjustments in the angle between the blade and the handle can be used. Short handles were once popular for the intubation of obese parturients as well as polio patients in the early days of mechanical ventilation (hence the moniker &quot;polio blade&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Optimizing the view</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">General guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following techniques can be used to improve an inadequate view of the glottis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use bimanual laryngoscopy, with external laryngeal manipulation. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Bimanual laryngoscopy (external laryngeal manipulation)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When performing curved blade laryngoscopy, be certain that the tip of the blade is correctly seated by noting how the epiglottis responds to small brief applications of pressure from the blade tip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the tongue contained within the left side of the mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase head elevation by flexing the lower neck. Have an assistant perform these maneuvers. Avoid the common tendency to extend the neck, which generally does not improve the view.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should the techniques above fail, use a laryngoscope blade of a different size or shape, or a tracheal tube introducer, or try a different approach (eg, paraglossal straight blade). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Paraglossal technique'</a> below and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Tracheal tube introducer (bougie)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Lifting the head and flexing the neck</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An inadequate view of the glottis can often be corrected by elevating the patient's head and flexing the lower neck. If the tip of the epiglottis does not appear when the base of the tongue is elevated with the laryngoscope, lifting the head reduces tension on the soft tissues and mobilizes the hyoid, which helps to bring the epiglottis into view. Elevating the head has consistently been shown to improve suboptimal views of the glottis during DL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outside the operating room</strong> &ndash; Outside of the operating room, some clinicians enlist the help of a knowledgeable assistant to lift the head and flex the neck under the guidance of the laryngoscopist. Use of an assistant allows the laryngoscopist to maintain the view of the larynx, control the tongue, and concentrate on performing bimanual laryngoscopy. In addition, it prevents the laryngoscopist's left arm from tiring, which allows for finer control of the laryngoscope, which is necessary for proper placement of the blade tip during curved blade laryngoscopy. Fatiguing arms can lead to a worsening view of the glottis, as control of the laryngoscope becomes compromised, and may cause the clinician to rush intubation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The assistant is positioned to the left of the patient's head. Under the direction of the laryngoscopist, the assistant lifts the head and flexes the lower neck (and upper thorax) in a controlled manner until the exposure of the glottis no longer improves. The force required to lift the head and flex the upper thorax can be considerably more than an unassisted operator can manage. However, some clinicians prefer to maneuver the head and neck into the optimal position themselves and then have their assistant maintain that position. The laryngoscopist should maintain the view of the larynx throughout the procedure, regardless of the method chosen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As the head is elevated and the neck flexed, the force vector of the laryngoscope handle rotates forward (or downward). Obtaining a good view of the glottis may require maximal flexion, which may in turn require that the operator lean far forward. Repositioning may be necessary to accomplish this (eg, lowering the bed or pulling the patient's head to the edge of the bed). Obviously, it is best if this potential need is anticipated and prepared for in advance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>General anesthesia in the operating room </strong>&ndash; Laryngoscopy for anesthesia is more commonly performed without having an assistant lift the patient's head. It may be accomplished by placing the right hand under the patient's occiput and lifting the head until the most favorable position is achieved. If necessary, the occiput can rest against the clinician's chest or abdomen for stability, while the right hand is used to insert the ETT. Throughout this process, the left hand continues to manipulate the laryngoscope, while the clinician continuously observes the larynx.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Bimanual laryngoscopy (external laryngeal manipulation)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bimanual laryngoscopy, also called external laryngeal manipulation (ELM), entails manipulating the thyroid cartilage or hyoid bone with the right hand in order to improve the view of the glottis. Observational studies and clinical experience suggest that ELM improves the view of the glottis substantially during most intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>The thumb and forefinger of the right hand can be placed on the thyroid cartilage as soon as that hand is no longer needed to help keep the mouth open and avoid injuring the lips and teeth during insertion of the laryngoscope blade. The intubator then uses the right hand to press and move the thyroid cartilage while observing the larynx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52096\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52096 \">picture 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64433\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64433 \">picture 14</a>). Once the optimal glottic view is obtained, the laryngoscopist has an assistant place their fingers in exactly the same spot on the thyroid cartilage, using the same direction and degree of force necessary to maintain the view. Blind attempts by an assistant to manipulate the larynx are not nearly as effective and should be discouraged. When applied early during DL, bimanual laryngoscopy enables the intubator to optimize the laryngeal view more effectively and efficiently than can be done by probing with the laryngoscope alone.</p><p>Regardless of blade type, when the hyoid is lifted, the glottis may be pulled anteriorly and out of the laryngoscopist's line of sight. Bimanual laryngoscopy counteracts the lifting forces of the laryngoscope, allowing the laryngeal structures to be brought into view.</p><p>Note that bimanual laryngoscopy is different than cricoid cartilage pressure (ie, Sellick's maneuver), which is performed to prevent passive regurgitation from the stomach during laryngoscopy. Performance of Sellick's maneuver is optional and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-for-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Positioning'</a>.)</p><p>The &quot;BURP&quot; maneuver (backward, upward, rightward pressure) is less effective at improving the glottic view than bimanual laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. This makes sense because the direction of the force needed to obtain the best view of the glottis varies among patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Glottic view scores</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two scoring systems are used to describe the view of the glottis obtained by DL. The Cormack-Lehane system provides a general description using four categories: grade I is a full view of the entire glottis; grade II is a view of the posterior portion of the glottic opening; grade III is a view of the epiglottis only; and with grade IV neither the epiglottis nor the glottis can be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55034 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score provides a more precise estimate of glottic exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. As an example, POGO scores 10, 50, and 90 convey important differences about the relative ease or difficulty of intubation that are not captured by the Cormack-Lehane system. Extremely limited views (eg, POGO score of 0, Cormack-Lehane score of III or IV) suggest that tube placement will be difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2897698437\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF LARYNGOSCOPE BLADE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinicians prefer to initiate laryngoscopy with a curved blade. The larger spatula and flange of most curved blades provides a greater area for viewing and manipulation of the tracheal tube. In addition, many clinicians prefer the feel of a curved blade, which more closely approximates the shape of the tongue and seats easily in the vallecula.</p><p>Nevertheless, the straight blade provides advantages in some circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. It frequently allows a more complete view of the laryngeal inlet, since the epiglottis is lifted out of the way. This is true in patients with a long, floppy epiglottis, which can be difficult to control using a curved blade placed in the vallecula. The straight blade may also provide a superior view when the larynx is situated anterior to the line of sight, or in patients with a receding chin or pathology at the base of the tongue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Such pathology blocks access to the vallecula and limits the pressure that can be placed on the hyoepiglottic ligament, which is essential for effective curved blade laryngoscopy.</p><p>It is often easier to insert a straight blade, rather than a curved blade, if the patient's mouth is small, mouth-opening is limited, or the front incisors are prominent. Also, when using a straight blade there is less of a tendency to lever back on the laryngoscope handle to elevate the epiglottis, which can damage protuberant teeth.</p><p>According to expert opinion and several observational studies, straight laryngoscope blades may be more effective during difficult intubations, particularly if a paraglossal approach is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. In the largest of these series, 160 patients undergoing general anesthesia were randomly assigned to intubation using either a paraglossal approach with a Miller blade or a standard approach with a Macintosh blade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

With either approach the clinician should first identify and control the tongue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/46,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,51</a>].</p><p>Some experts recommend insertion in the midline, preferring to concentrate on identifying the epiglottis first and then maneuvering the flange of the blade to push the tongue to the left side of the mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. They believe midline insertion, particularly for those learning the technique, makes it easier to find the epiglottis and reduces the risk of anatomic distortion that may occur with lateral insertion and retraction. In either case, the tongue must be kept out of the line of sight while the glottis is located.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 3: Carefully advance the blade toward the epiglottis in a controlled manner, gently lifting the blade tip every few millimeters.</strong></p><p/><p>Identification of the epiglottis, which lies at the base of the tongue, is the key step to successful direct laryngoscopy. Carefully but steadily advancing and lifting the laryngoscope blade should enable the clinician to find the epiglottis readily. Inserting or advancing the laryngoscope blade in an uncontrolled manner without properly identifying the epiglottis can cause the blade to bypass the epiglottis and even the larynx, potentially resulting in injury or esophageal intubation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 4: Advance the tip of the blade into the vallecula, the recess between the base of the tongue and the epiglottis.</strong></p><p/><p>Avoid folding the epiglottis with the blade, which may partially or completely obscure the glottis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51761 \">picture 15</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 5: Identify the best spot for elevating the epiglottis.</strong></p><p/><p>Ideally, the tip of the blade is placed against the hyoepiglottic ligament (HEL), the cord-like structure that attaches the epiglottis to the hyoid bone. When the view is optimal, the ligament may be seen as a midline structure dividing the vallecula into two almond-shaped spaces.</p><p>Once the laryngoscope blade is seen to raise the epiglottis, the objective is to press the blade tip into the HEL at approximately a right angle to elevate the epiglottis. Usually the HEL cannot be seen directly so positioning is best achieved by &quot;spooning.&quot; Spooning consists of advancing the blade a few millimeters at a time, lifting the blade forward in the direction of the handle, and then observing the response of the epiglottis. Lifting during spooning involves small forward pulsing movements of the blade tip. Observing the response to successive small pulsing lifts is invaluable for finding the optimal position.</p><p>Brisk elevation of the epiglottis during spooning indicates optimal placement against the HEL in the first few millimeters below the hyoid. Twisting to one side indicates tip placement lateral to the HEL on the corresponding side. Sluggish elevation may be due to inadequate advance (still on the tongue or against the hyoid) or inadequate elevation of the patient's head, resulting in an angle of approach that is too acute. Movement of the tip of the epiglottis away from the operator indicates that the blade tip is placed at too acute an angle on the epiglottis or lies too distal on the epiglottis, which may be due to inadequate caudad displacement of the tongue. In either case, the blade should be pulled back a few millimeters while the head is further elevated, as this improves both tongue displacement and the angle of approach to the HEL.</p><p>An alternative approach to identifying the best location for the blade tip is external manipulation of the larynx. This is done by pressing on the thyroid cartilage with the fingers of the right hand and making repeated small, brief movements while gradually adjusting the position of the blade tip. The clinician can thereby determine which blade tip position creates the greatest elevation of the epiglottis. Simultaneous external manipulation of the larynx and spooning reduce the time required for optimal positioning of the blade tip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Bimanual laryngoscopy (external laryngeal manipulation)'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 6: Lift the laryngoscope in the direction of the handle, thereby exposing the glottis; do not lever back on the teeth with the laryngoscope handle</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62054\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62054 \">picture 16</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80614\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80614 \">picture 17</a>)<strong>.</strong></p><p/><p>Once the blade tip is properly positioned, lift the laryngoscope. A properly positioned blade tip may allow for an excellent view of the glottis without requiring a great deal of lifting force. However, in some cases significant exertion may be needed. Keep your elbow in (ie, arm adducted) for maximal lifting strength. Many novices begin lifting before the blade is correctly positioned, which may result in a poor view, arm fatigue, or both.</p><p>When lifting a laryngoscope with a curved blade, the correct initial force vector points approximately 45 degrees from the plane of the floor. This lifting motion elevates the epiglottis, keeps the tongue out of the line of sight, and maximizes exposure of the glottis. It also prevents levering back on the teeth.</p><p>Even when exposure is adequate for endotracheal intubation, we recommend routinely elevating the head to gain optimal exposure for easier intubation, so that when difficult cases are encountered, optimal practice is already the routine. Techniques for optimizing the view of the glottis are described above. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Lifting the head and flexing the neck'</a> above.)</p><p>The natural inclination for many novice intubators is to lever backwards on the laryngoscope handle. This motion can not only damage teeth but may interfere with the laryngoscopist's view as well.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 7: Optimize the glottic view as needed with external laryngeal manipulation, head elevation, and neck flexion. These techniques are described in detail separately.</strong> (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Optimizing the view'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The optimal head and neck position is determined empirically by the best view of the glottis that can be obtained. Early manipulation of the thyroid cartilage with the laryngoscopist's right hand should be used routinely to improve the view.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 8: Place the tracheal tube.</strong></p><p/><p>Perform all emergent intubations with a stylet in the tracheal tube. The angle of the endotracheal tube (ETT) stylet should not exceed 35 degrees, and the stylet (and ETT) should be straight from the proximal end to the cuff. More acute angles at the end of the ETT (eg, &quot;hockey stick&quot; conformation) may cause the tip to become stuck on the anterior trachea, preventing advancement (and possibly traumatizing the airway) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this shape, the ETT can pass lateral to the blade as it enters the mouth and dorsal to (ie, below) the blade as it is advanced, allowing the clinician to maintain the view of the glottis as the tube is advanced.</p><p>It is helpful to have an assistant retract the right side of the lip laterally to increase the space available to insert the ETT. Experienced operators can use the little and ring fingers of the right hand to retract the lip, while the other fingers grasp and pass the ETT, although this approach is more challenging.</p><p>Avoid putting the ETT into your line of vision while advancing it into the oropharynx. The ETT should enter the mouth lateral to the blade and travel along the palate below the line of sight. It then should be manipulated so the tip appears from below at the glottic opening. This allows the clinician to watch the ETT advance into the glottis. In addition, this approach makes the leading edge of the ETT appear vertical and enables the clinician to watch the bevel enter the slit-shaped opening between the vocal cords. </p><p>Once the tip of the ETT has passed the vocal cords, the laryngoscopist should pause and ask an assistant to remove the stylet. Inserting the ETT further with the stylet in place may cause injury or obstruct tube passage. While the stylet is removed, the laryngoscopist should maintain a firm grasp of the ETT to prevent dislodgement and should keep the glottis and tube in view.</p><p>Advance the ETT until it rests at 21 cm at the front incisors for women or 23 cm for men. Adjustment may be needed based upon auscultation or the position noted on chest radiograph.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">STRAIGHT BLADE LARYNGOSCOPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Straight blade techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A straight blade may be inserted to the right of the tongue (paraglossal technique) or in the midline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. The paraglossal approach involves inserting the straight blade into the natural gutter between the tongue and the lower molars. The Miller blade, with its short flange and narrow spatula, is particularly useful in this relatively cramped space. By inserting the blade in the paraglossal gutter, the tongue is generally well displaced with minimal effort and a better view is obtained. In addition, the distance to the epiglottis is shorter compared with a midline approach.</p><p>The &quot;retromolar&quot; or &quot;molar&quot; approach uses a more lateral insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Blind thrusting of the blade against the mucosa in the periglottic region may injure the larynx, pharynx, or esophagus. Furthermore, lifting the laryngoscope while it is positioned in the hypopharynx may reveal the orifice of the proximal esophagus and mislead the inexperienced intubator, leading to an esophageal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step 5: Once the epiglottis is identified, advance the tip of the blade posterior to the epiglottis and into the laryngeal inlet.

Avoid using the barrel of the blade to guide insertion of the ETT. Rather, pass it below (cephalad to) the blade, close to the roof of the mouth. Often it will not be visible until it arrives at the posterior commissure. Insert it directly into the trachea while watching the tube pass between the vocal cords. This allows one to retain control of the direction of tube insertion and permits visualization of the tip as it passes into the laryngeal opening.</p><p>The lips often impede the view and placement of the ETT when using a paraglossal approach. Avoid this obstacle by having an assistant retract the lip laterally. Alternatively, use the ring and little fingers of the right hand to do so, although this is generally more cumbersome.</p><p>The ETT should not be inserted through the barrel of a straight laryngoscope blade, as doing so obscures the view of the glottis. If there is not enough space to insert the ETT beside the blade, a tracheal tube introducer (ie, bougie) may be placed through the cords, and the ETT then inserted over the introducer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1688094736\"><span class=\"h1\">TIPS FOR ADVANCING A STUCK TRACHEAL TUBE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes entry into the glottis is problematic due to its position (so-called &quot;anterior&quot; larynx) or crowding of structures in the oral cavity and pharynx, which may obstruct the course of the styletted tube during insertion. One maneuver that may help in such situations is to rotate the endotracheal tube (ETT) clockwise 90 degrees as the ETT tip approaches the glottis, which causes the ETT to approach more laterally and allows for a better view of the glottis, and then rotating the ETT back counterclockwise to the original position (vertical orientation) to place the tip through the glottis.</p><p>In difficult intubations, when the tip of the ETT may not be visible during attempts to insert it into the glottis (eg, percentage of glottic opening [POGO] &lt;10 percent, and guidance provided by posterior cartilages), it is not unusual for the bevel of the ETT to catch on the aryepiglottic folds. This is more common if a &quot;bougie&quot; or other ETT exchange device is being used, or when intubating over a fiberoptic scope, as the space between the ETT and the device within it can permit lateral movement of the tip of the tube relative to the device, allowing the tip to catch on soft tissues as it enters the glottis. In this situation, when resistance is perceived it is often helpful to retract the ETT a short distance (1 to 2 cm) to disengage it from the soft tissues, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, and then attempt re-insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Specialized ETTs with flexible, bull-nose tips (ie, Parker Flex-Tip) have been found to reduce the incidence of such difficulty during entry into the glottis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111600\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111600 \">picture 20</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>During insertion, sometimes the ETT comes into contact with the anterior tracheal wall after the tip passes between the vocal cords, where it may meet resistance and fail to advance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. When such resistance develops, in most cases withdrawing the stylet allows the tip to drop away from the anterior wall and the ETT to be advanced. Clinicians should avoid using excessive force to advance the ETT or to &quot;screw&quot; it into position as injury may result.</p><p>Another means of coping with this problem is to gently rotate the ETT 90 degrees clockwise after the tip passes between the vocal cords, which positions the bevel facing upwards (anteriorly), and helps to deflect the ETT from the anterior wall. In an extreme situation, the ETT may have to be rotated further to cope with a sharp posterior angulation of the trachea relative to the axis of the larynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-laryngoscopy-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3912020395\"><span class=\"h1\">NASAL INTUBATION USING DIRECT LARYNGOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasotracheal intubation is rarely performed outside the operating room but may be required for a variety of surgical procedures.

The most accurate way to evaluate ETT placement with ultrasonography is with dynamic scanning of the tracheal region during the intubation, which requires that a skilled second clinician be present to perform and interpret the ultrasound scan.
