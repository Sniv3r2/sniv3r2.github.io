This technology has provided a minimally invasive option for diagnosis or treatment of women with common gynecologic issues, such as abnormal uterine bleeding or uterine fibroids.</p><p>Panoramic hysteroscopy is the most common method. A uterine distending medium is used to allow a global view of the endometrial cavity. Carbon dioxide and low viscosity fluids are the most frequently used distending media. Each medium has advantages and disadvantages, including specific safety concerns.</p><p>Contact hysteroscopy is another method, but it is rarely performed. Since no distending medium is used, only tissue in direct contact with the scope can be viewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Use of and prevention and management of complications from hysteroscopic distending media will be reviewed here.

High-viscosity fluids (ie, 32 percent dextran 70 [Hyskon]) are no longer used because they are associated with increased risk of complications (eg, electrolyte imbalance, anaphylaxis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation) and can ruin expensive hysteroscopic equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Fluid distending media may be either electrolyte (eg, normal saline, lactated Ringer's) or electrolyte-poor (eg, glycine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>). The choice of fluid type depends upon whether a diagnostic or operative procedure is planned and on the surgeon's choice of equipment (ie, monopolar or bipolar energy source). Each type of fluid can result in complications if not used properly. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Complications and adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrolyte</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two types of low-viscosity distending media: those that contain electrolytes and those that do not. The electrolyte-containing media include normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution and cannot be used with monopolar electrosurgery because they conduct electric current (but can be used with mechanical morcellators, mechanical tissue removal systems, laser, or bipolar energy). The electrolyte-poor solutions are 5 percent dextrose, 1.5 percent glycine, 3 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> and 5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, and are used with monopolar energy systems.</p><p>The electrolyte fluids used for hysteroscopy are isoosmolar (isotonic), and thus do not disturb the osmolar balance between intracellular and extracellular fluid. While the risks of fluid absorption are associated mainly with electrolyte-poor fluids, intravasation of large volumes of electrolyte fluid can also lead to fluid overload (eg, pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrolyte-poor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrolyte-poor fluids that are used most commonly for hysteroscopy are: 1.5 percent glycine, 3 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, 5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>. Each has different properties and is metabolized by a different mechanism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71692\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71692 \">table 1</a>). The physiology of these fluids is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia following transurethral resection or hysteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All the electrolyte-poor fluids used in hysteroscopy can lead to hyponatremia if a large volume is absorbed. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mannitol</a> differs from the others because it is isoosmolar, but is not commonly used because it is not available in the 3 L bags typically used for hysteroscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflow and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflow and monitoring are controlled by the hysteroscope and a continuous fluid monitoring device. The surgeon should be frequently updated regarding the fluid deficit, particularly when the deficit approaches 500 mL. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and management of fluid overload'</a> below.)</p><p>We prefer a hysteroscope that has a dual outer sheath or dual port system with an outflow port that can be directly connected to a vacuum collecting system. This gives an accurate assessment of the fluid deficit, as less media is lost in the drapes, towels, or on the operating room floor. </p><p>Use of an automated fluid pump and monitoring system is advocated by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Automated systems have the following advantages over manual set-ups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continually measure fluid deficit and provide automated alerts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Automated cessation of inflow of fluid when the fluid deficit is reached</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement and titration of intrauterine fluid pressure</p><p/><p>Most automated hysteroscopic pump systems allow you to set the desired intrauterine pressure manually, and the system will then adjust the flow of fluid to maintain this pressure. In addition, automated pump systems should be set to give audible alerts at when the pre-set fluid deficit is reached.</p><p>Titrating intrauterine pressure is important to manage bleeding, facilitate full resection of endometrial lesions, and decrease &quot;false-negative&quot; views of the endometrial cavity that may occur with higher or constant endometrial pressure. The surgeon should use the lowest pressure that allows optimal visualization. Typically, intrauterine pressure ranges from 70 to 80 mmHg. Higher pressures (up to 125 to 150 mmHg) may be required for patients with intrauterine bleeding, blood clots, or other debris; a uterine wall that is less compliant than average; or a uterus that is large <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has intramural fibroids. A higher intrauterine pressure may result in increased absorption or extravasation of the distending medium. Thus, if a higher pressure is used, the fluid deficit should be monitored closely, the procedure should be performed as quickly as possible, and the pressure should be lowered if the higher pressure is no longer needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-following-transurethral-resection-or-hysteroscopy#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia following transurethral resection or hysteroscopy&quot;, section on 'Minimize fluid pressure'</a>.)</p><p>Where automated systems are not available, a manual technique is used. Fluid is infused using the force of gravity (ie, elevating the fluid bag) or by placing the fluid bag in a large blood pressure cuff and inflating the cuff. Fluid input and output are recorded manually.</p><p>A surgical staff member should be designated to frequently measure the input and output and report the deficit to the surgeon. To record fluid input manually, the volume of fluid in each bag must be known. Some surgeons make calculations based on the common assertion that fluid bags are generally overfilled by 10 percent or more (eg, a 1000 mL bag of normal saline is considered to have 1100 mL or more); this leads to an overestimate of the fluid deficit. However, a study of bags of normal saline, glycine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> found that the average overfill was only 3 to 6 percent of the bag volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Fluid overload'</a> below.)</p><p>To avoid hypothermia during longer procedures (ie, operative versus diagnostic hysteroscopy), fluid distending media should be warmed to room temperature at a minimum; hypothermia may potentiate the risk of acidemia and cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Gaseous media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbon dioxide is the only gaseous medium used in hysteroscopy; it is used solely for diagnostic hysteroscopy. It provides a clear field of view, is rapidly absorbed, and has a long history of safety in tubal patency testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; it is also widely available and makes cleaning of instruments easy. However, it is best suited for diagnostic rather than operative hysteroscopy, since gas bubbles form in association with intrauterine bleeding and impair visualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Carbon dioxide must be insufflated with a special instrument known as a hysteroinsufflator. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of gas embolism'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on operative visualization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The angle of view and magnification vary with the refractory index of the distending medium. Gaseous media (eg, carbon dioxide) allow perception of the maximal angle of view, while liquid media reduce the angle of view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Use of gaseous media is usually limited to diagnostic procedures, since gas bubble may interfere with visualization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid overload is rare, occurring in 0.06 to 0.2 percent of operative hysteroscopy procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Complications related to distending media vary according to the patient population, length of procedure, size of intracavitary pathology, depth of fibroid penetration into the myometrium, creation of false tracks or cervical laceration, type of pathology (polyp versus fibroid), and the medium used.</p><p>A patient's ability to adapt to fluid overload varies with age and comorbid conditions. Absorption of large volumes of electrolyte-poor fluid may result in the following complications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume overload &ndash; acute decompensated heart failure, pulmonary edema, laryngeal edema, dilutional anemia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolyte or other plasma imbalance &ndash; hyponatremia, hypoosmolality, hyperammonemia, hyperglycemia, acidosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic sequelae &ndash; slurred speech, visual disturbances, hypersomnia, confusion, seizures, coma</p><p/><p>During hysteroscopy, absorption is increased when venous sinuses are exposed (eg, during myomectomy with Type 1 and Type 2 leiomyomas, endomyometrial resection, septum resection that is too deep, difficult Asherman&rsquo;s syndrome cases). In addition, minimal fluid extravasates through the Fallopian tubes; history of prior sterilization does not alter total absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Hyponatremia is a particular risk with electrolyte-poor fluids.

Know the patient&rsquo;s mean arterial pressure (MAP), because the intrauterine pressure will need to be higher than the MAP to achieve excellent visualization. While in general intrauterine fluid pressure set at or 70 to 80 mmHg will achieve this, higher pressure up to 125 to 150 mmHg may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit surgical time to &lt;1 hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>These measures are discussed in detail separately.

This was illustrated in randomized trials in women undergoing operative hysteroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Intracervical injections of a dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> solution (eg, 1 unit per 20 mL normal saline) at two sites around the cervix, 10 mL each, before the procedure compared with placebo resulted in a three-fold decrease in fluid absorption. Blood loss was also decreased.</p><p>Other methods of limiting fluid absorption during hysteroscopy have not been widely adopted. Treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog reduced deficits in one small randomized trial (n = 17), however, these results have not been further evaluated and the side effects (eg, hot flashes, mood changes, and costs) induced by these drugs may outweigh possible benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis and management of fluid overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious complications of electrolyte-poor fluid overload have been reported at a fluid deficit of 500 to 1000 mL and are more likely to occur in patients with comorbidities (eg, heart and renal disease). Thus, depending upon the type of fluid used and the health status of the patient, when the fluid deficit reaches 500 mL, the surgical team should pause and assess patient status. After estimating the amount of time necessary to complete the procedure, the team should either expedite the completion of the procedure or terminate the procedure.</p><p>For nonconductive, electrolyte-poor fluids, the procedure should be terminated when 1000 mL has been absorbed and the patient evaluated for hyponatremia.

In addition, all procedures should be terminated if uterine perforation occurs, since large volumes of fluid may rapidly enter the circulation via the peritoneal cavity, cause compression on great vessels, and respiratory compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine perforation during gynecologic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a criterion for stopping a procedure is met, the following steps should be taken to evaluate the patient:</p><p>(1) Halt procedure &ndash; Discontinue fluid inflow, remove all instruments; if there is active bleeding, a 10 to 30 mL Foley catheter can be inserted in the uterine cavity, inflated, and removed after six to eight hours if the patient is hemodynamically stable and bleeding has stopped. A larger intrauterine balloon, such as a Bakri balloon for postpartum hemorrhage, may be required if the uterus is larger because of fibroids or adenomyosis. Overdistension of the intrauterine cavity should be avoided to minimize the risk of uterine rupture.</p><p>(2) Ask about symptoms of volume overload, hyponatremia, or glycine toxicity (in patients who are not under sedation or general anesthesia) &ndash; Nausea, headache, visual disturbance, prickling or burning sensation in the face and neck, chest pain, shortness of breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. If present, rapidly administer IV Lasix for fluid overload and monitor urine output for diuresis.</p><p>(3) Evaluate hemodynamic status &ndash; Vital signs, central venous pressure, oxygen saturation.</p><p>(4) Evaluate mental, respiratory, and cardiovascular status.</p><p>(5) Perform laboratory evaluation &ndash; Hematocrit, platelets, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, glucose, ammonia (glycine is metabolized to ammonia), and plasma osmolality.</p><p>Evaluation of the patient should be individualized according to a patient's comorbidities. For example, there is a higher risk of sequelae from metabolism of glycine to ammonia in a patient with liver disease.

Alternatively, IV Lasix can be administered in an anticipatory manner. Plasma dilution peaks at approximately 15 to 20 minutes after fluid infusion, but fluid and electrolyte shifts continue for several hours afterward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopy-managing-fluid-and-gas-distending-media/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>If a fluid-related complication is suspected, an intraoperative management plan must be initiated by the surgeon and anesthesiologist. Depending on the degree of fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance, management may include observation, diuresis, intravenous administration of corrective fluids (eg, hypertonic saline), or hemodialysis.

The type of distension medium may affect the likelihood of shoulder pain.

Bipolar electrosurgical procedures may be performed using an isotonic fluid (eg, normal saline or lactated Ringer's), which avoids the risks of electrolyte and osmolar imbalances associated with nonconductive solutions.</p><p>Types of media, biochemical properties, adverse effects, and safety measures are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71692\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71692 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most simple diagnostic-only hysteroscopic procedures utilize a fluid or gaseous uterine distending medium to allow a global view. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative hysteroscopy can be performed with either monopolar or bipolar electrical energy. Electrolyte-poor fluids are used with monopolar systems. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fluid media'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolyte containing fluid media is utilized for mechanical hysteroscopic morcellators (tissue extraction devices) and bipolar hysteroscopy resectoscopes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive absorption of any fluid medium can lead to complications of fluid overload. The most serious complication is intravasation of large volumes of electrolyte-poor media resulting in hyponatremia.
