Facial injuries can impair a patient's ability to eat, speak, interact with others, and perform other important functions. Studies suggest that disfiguring facial injuries can have severe psychological and social consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. The treatment of facial injuries must first focus on threats to life, but important secondary considerations are function and long-term cosmesis.</p><p>The basic anatomy, clinical manifestations, and acute management of facial trauma in adults will be reviewed here. Eye injuries, pediatric facial trauma, and other aspects of facial trauma management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-globe-injuries-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open globe injuries: Emergency evaluation and initial management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-detachment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal detachment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal trauma in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nasal-trauma-and-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nasal trauma and fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaw-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jaw fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sports like football, baseball, and hockey account for a high percentage of facial injuries among young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]. Severe injuries often occur as a result of motor vehicle collisions, including those involving motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles, as well as interpersonal and domestic violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Other mechanisms include falls, animal bites, and recreational activities. Among combatants, facial injuries occur from gunshot wounds and other explosive or incendiary devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Facial trauma sustained from gunshot wounds or explosions is associated with greater morbidity and higher mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Associated head and cervical spine injuries are common in patients with significant facial trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND MECHANISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The face is anatomically complex. It includes skin, muscles responsible for both gross motor function (eg, mastication) and subtle facial expression, a complex bony structure, and vital sensory organs. Injuries to the face may compromise the patient's ability to breathe, see, speak, hear, and eat, and may involve damage to the central nervous system.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bones</strong> &ndash; The posterior portions of the face form the anterior wall of the calvaria. Thus, the face lies in close proximity to the central nervous system. The anterior facial skeleton is composed of the frontal bone, nasal bones, zygomas, maxillary bones, and mandible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51391 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82226 \">figure 2</a>). The sphenoid, ethmoid, lacrimal, vomer, and temporal bones lie deeper within the facial structure, providing support and sites for muscular attachments, including the muscles used for chewing, speaking, and swallowing.<br/><br/>The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the only joint of the face and it engages in complex motions. The condyle of the mandible rotates and translates anteriorly (ie, moves forward) when the mouth opens. A meniscus, which overlies the condyle, maintains the joint and enables motion. The meniscus and the condyle form a hinged joint, allowing rotation, while the meniscus and the temporal bone form a sliding joint, allowing translation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nerves</strong> &ndash; Cranial nerve V (trigeminal) supplies sensation to the face through three major divisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52850 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63085\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63085 \">figure 4</a>). The ophthalmic division (V1) supplies sensation to the upper third of the face, including the eye and the nose down to the tip. The maxillary division (V2) provides innervation to the midface and includes the infraorbital nerve. The mandibular division (V3) supplies sensation to the lower third of the face. The most anterior muscle layer includes the muscles of facial expression, which are innervated by cranial nerve VII (facial nerve) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55677\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55677 \">figure 5</a>). The facial nerve travels through a narrow canal within the temporal bone and is susceptible to injury when the bone is fractured. The muscles of mastication are innervated by cranial nerves V (jaw movement), IX, and X (palatal movement). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vasculature</strong> &ndash; The face is highly vascular. Soft tissue injuries and fractures that involve vessels can cause large hematomas or heavy bleeding, or even exsanguination in severe cases. Because the face has extensive arterial anastomoses, including some that cross the face's midline, ligation of major branches is unlikely to cause ischemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50495\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50495 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glands</strong> &ndash; The parotid glands lie anterior to the auricle and posterior to the ramus of the mandible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 7</a>). The parotid (ie, Stensen's) duct travels anteriorly in the horizontal plane and opens in the inner wall of the cheek opposite the second upper molar. The submandibular and sublingual salivary glands are rarely injured because of their better-protected location. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salivary-gland-stones#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salivary gland stones&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscles</strong> &ndash; Facial musculature is complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90038\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90038 \">table 1</a>). Important muscles that may be injured with facial trauma include the extraocular muscles and those surrounding the mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72674\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72674 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90918\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90918 \">figure 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90919\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90919 \">figure 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90917 \">figure 11</a>). The inferior rectus, primarily responsible for rotating the eye downward, can become entrapped in fractures of the orbital floor. The orbicularis oris, which encircles the mouth, frequently requires repair with complete perioral lacerations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin</strong> &ndash; The skin of the face is among the thinnest of the body. Facial skin develops predictable creases with age, following Langer's lines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50913\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50913 \">figure 12</a>). Lacerations that do not run parallel to Langer's lines develop more prominent scarring than those that do.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injuries occur when energy (most often kinetic) transferred to the body exceeds the tolerance of the tissue. The likelihood of injury is related to the amount of energy transferred and the condition of the underlying tissue. Traditionally, trauma has been classified as blunt or penetrating, but in many cases the effect is a combination. As an example, the forehead injury sustained when someone falls against the sharp corner of a coffee table involves both a contusion (blunt injury) and a laceration (penetrating injury).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prehospital trauma management is discussed in detail separately. Special considerations in patients with facial trauma are described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The general indications for airway management remain unchanged in patients with facial trauma. If intubation must be performed in the field, orotracheal intubation is strongly preferred to blind nasotracheal intubation for patients with facial trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-the-adult-with-direct-airway-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in the adult with direct airway trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Facial fractures can affect airway management in several ways. Mandible fractures may make intubation easier by allowing the mouth to be opened wider and more easily. However, facial fractures can increase the difficulty of ventilating with a bag-valve-mask, and possibly impede performance of the jaw thrust maneuver. Thus, a cautious approach including proper assessment of the airway should be performed whenever possible prior to performing rapid sequence intubation.</p><p>Bleeding from severe facial wounds can complicate endotracheal intubation. The simultaneous use of two suction devices may be required. Bleeding in many areas of the face can be controlled during transport with external compression. Severe intraoral bleeding or epistaxis can be more difficult to manage. With severe anterior nasal bleeding, tamponade can often still be achieved by pinching the alae tightly against the septum. Epistaxis management is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-epistaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with epistaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In an alert patient with intraoral bleeding, 4 x 4 cm gauze packing may be held firmly, with the fingers pressed against the site of bleeding, or clamped between the jaws if the wound lies along the alveolar ridge. Alert patients may be able to perform these maneuvers themselves. Complete (ie, &quot;through and through&quot;) lacerations of the buccal space may be packed and compression applied externally. Another method is to impregnate gauze with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and press it against the bleeding site using a forceps or similar tool.</p><p>Patients with severe oropharyngeal bleeding who do not require spinal immobilization should be allowed to assume a position of comfort. They can sit leaning forward and may be allowed to suction themselves. If spinal immobilization is required, and provided the patient is alert and bleeding is not severe, the backboard may be tilted with the bleeding side down, to protect the airway and allow suctioning.</p><p>If these maneuvers are insufficient to control bleeding and the patient's injuries require spinal immobilization, intubation may be necessary to protect the airway. Following intubation, large amounts of gauze can be placed in the oropharynx and nasopharynx to obtain control via direct pressure.</p><p>On rare occasions, vascular injuries in the face cause significant hematomas that extend into the neck or supraclavicular region. There may be little external bleeding. Anatomic distortion of the pharynx and neck from such bleeding can make intubation and cricothyroidotomy difficult. In such circumstances, if transport time is short, definitive airway management is best deferred until the patient reaches the emergency department provided the following conditions are met:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient is conscious and protecting their airway and breathing adequately with SpO2 maintained above 90 percent</p><p/><p>OR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventilation can be performed without difficulty using a rescue airway (eg, laryngeal mask airway [LMA]) or bag-mask with SpO2 maintained above 90 percent</p><p/><p>Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel should notify the receiving institution of the patient's condition so preparations can be made for a difficult intubation.</p><p>If EMS personnel suspect a ruptured globe, protection to prevent compression of the eye (eg, eye cup or noncontact shielding) should be placed in the field. Avulsed tissue, including ears, the tip of the nose, or large skin flaps, should be transported with the patient in saline-soaked gauze. Full-thickness skin flaps are often more readily reattached to the face than other body parts. Therefore, whenever EMS personnel are in doubt about the viability of avulsed tissue, they should transport the tissue with the patient.</p><p>Avulsed teeth should be transported with the patient. Patients with normal mental status who are able to protect their airway may be able to carry avulsed teeth in their mouths, held between the gum and buccal mucosa. Patients who are intoxicated or otherwise altered, complain of nausea or vomiting, and those who require cervical spine immobilization or who cannot be transported upright are at risk of aspiration and should NOT be allowed to carry avulsed teeth in their mouth. In such cases, teeth should be transported in a container of sterile saline. Incompletely avulsed teeth should be left in place and not manipulated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disfiguring facial injuries can be distracting to both the patient and the clinician. Nevertheless, clinicians must focus on the basics of trauma care (ie, the primary survey) and address all life-threatening injuries before performing a complete facial examination. As part of the primary survey, injuries to the oropharynx or lower face that compromise the airway or impair breathing are identified and pupillary size and reaction are assessed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-the-adult-with-direct-airway-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in the adult with direct airway trauma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After problems identified during the primary survey are adequately addressed, a secondary survey, including careful assessment of facial injuries, must be performed. The secondary survey should include a systematic approach and examination of all major facial structures and functions. A complete evaluation is outlined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to obtaining a basic history of the injury and past medical problems, the clinician should seek answers to the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can you breathe through both sides of your nose?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you having any trouble speaking?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have double vision or any other trouble with your vision?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is your hearing normal?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you experiencing any numbness of your face?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you had any previous facial injuries or surgeries, including procedures to correct vision (eg, LASIK)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do your teeth come together the way they did yesterday?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are any of your teeth painful or loose?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were you bleeding from your mouth, nose, or ears?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you experienced any vertigo?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">General examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examination begins by observing the patient's face for any structural asymmetry or gross discrepancies in motor function. It is helpful to observe the face from more than one perspective. Lacerations, abrasions, contusions, and tissue avulsions are usually obvious. Careful assessment of underlying structures is important and all injuries should be carefully documented.</p><p>Subtle discrepancies can be important. As an example, differences in the relative positions of the eyeballs may lead to the diagnosis of orbital fractures. Orbital fractures can cause enophthalmos (sunken eye due to fracture of the orbital floor) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76971\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76971 \">picture 1</a>), extraocular muscle entrapment (inability to move the eye properly) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79690\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79690 \">picture 2</a>), hypoesthesia from nerve entrapment, or exophthalmos (from retrobulbar hematoma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76607\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76607 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Increased intercanthal distance (telecanthus) suggests the presence of a naso-orbito-ethmoid fracture (as opposed to an isolated nasal fracture), which is typically associated with significant orbital swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. Such injuries may be associated with a basal skull fracture. Normal intercanthal distance (distance between the medial corners of the eye) ranges from approximately 28 to 34 mm in adults, or about the horizontal length of one eye. Facial edema may obscure measurements such as intercanthal distance. Other findings that may be present with a naso-orbito-ethmoid injury include diplopia, nasal congestion or epistaxis, vision abnormalities, dizziness, and anosmia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skull-fractures-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skull fractures in adults&quot;, section on 'Basilar skull fracture'</a>.)</p><p>Next, the clinician palpates the bony prominences of the face feeling for focal tenderness, step-off, crepitus, and abnormal motion.</p><p>Both facial nerve motor function (CN VII) and sensation (CN V1, V2, V3) should be assessed carefully. Acute facial paralysis suggests possible transection of the facial nerve or one of its branches and requires immediate consultation with a maxillofacial surgeon; paralysis that evolves over a few days may be related to nerve swelling and also warrants consultation. Performance of the neurologic examination is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Documentation is a crucial part of the examination in facial trauma, which may result from violent crime, physical abuse, domestic altercation, or an industrial accident. Careful documentation, including photographs or drawings, assists in communicating with other clinicians and provides important forensic evidence that may be helpful in cases that result in litigation or criminal prosecution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination of specific body parts</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eyes</strong> &ndash; The eye examination should include evaluation of visual acuity and extraocular movements and close inspection for signs of injury (eg, afferent pupillary defect, hyphema, corneal abrasion, orbital step-off). Patients who have undergone procedures to correct their vision (eg, LASIK) may sustain disruption of the corneal flap as part of their facial injury. Visual acuity is decreased and the flap may be visible on simple inspection. Such injuries require urgent ophthalmologic evaluation.<br/><br/>Assessment and management of ocular trauma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-globe-injuries-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open globe injuries: Emergency evaluation and initial management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-detachment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal detachment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Management&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Examination of vision and the eye is also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=slit-lamp-examination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Slit lamp examination&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Intraocular injuries take precedence over eyelid lacerations or canalicular injuries and should be evaluated emergently by an ophthalmologist. Lacerations involving the medial canthus or the medial third of the upper or lower eyelid raise suspicion for damage to the canalicular drainage system. Such injuries generally require assessment by ophthalmology or plastic surgery and can usually be repaired by a specialist up to 48 hours after the injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nose</strong> &ndash; Examination of the nose includes palpation for tenderness, crepitus, and abnormal movement, and inspection using a nasal speculum. The septum is inspected for signs of trauma, including a septal hematoma, which requires urgent drainage, and rhinorrhea, which may represent a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. A septal hematoma appears as a dark purple or bluish mass against the septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51798 \">picture 4</a>). They can be bilateral if blood dissects through a fracture of the nasal cartilage, and thus both nares should be examined closely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Midface</strong> &ndash; Midface fractures involving the zygoma may manifest as a large contusion over the cheekbone, enophthalmos, or malocclusion of the upper teeth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51391 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55561\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55561 \">figure 13</a>). Anaesthesia of the area supplied by the infraorbital nerve (ipsilateral lower eyelid, lateral nose, upper lip, anterior maxilla) is a subtle sign of an orbital floor fracture. Such patients may manifest periorbital ecchymosis and lose the ability to look up due to entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79690\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79690 \">picture 2</a>). Fractures through the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus may also injure the dentoalveolar nerves, leading to denervation of the maxillary teeth.<br/><br/>More forceful trauma can cause extensive fractures, creating midface instability. Assessment involves inspection, palpation, and manipulation to determine the presence of midface instability. To assess instability, grasp the superior anterior teeth (or alveolar ridge if teeth are absent) between the thumb and index finger and attempt to move the maxilla anteriorly and posteriorly, while stabilizing the patient's forehead with the opposite hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63111\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63111 \">figure 14</a>). Assessments of facial stability should be performed gently to minimize pain and avoid increased bleeding. Unstable fractures display obvious mobility. Other findings that may be present with naso-orbito-ethmoid injury include facial discrepancies or asymmetry (eg, enophthalmos, increased intercanthal distance), diplopia, nasal congestion or epistaxis, vision abnormalities, dizziness, and anosmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mouth, maxilla, and mandible</strong> &ndash; Dysphonia or edema of the oropharynx suggests the presence of a significant hematoma or fracture, and each is associated with an increased risk of airway compromise. Stridor or drooling also suggests airway difficulty. It is best to secure the airway early with endotracheal intubation if it is felt to be at risk of obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-difficult-airway-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the difficult airway in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-decision-to-intubate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The decision to intubate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-the-adult-with-direct-airway-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in the adult with direct airway trauma&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Occlusion is best evaluated by asking the alert and cooperative patient to close their mouth and describe whether the motion and positioning feel normal. There is wide variability in occlusion and the patient's assessment is more sensitive than the clinician's impression of a fracture of the mandible or alveolar ridge. Malocclusion suggests the presence of a mandibular fracture.<br/><br/>Thorough inspection and palpation of the face and mouth may reveal signs of injury. Lacerations or a gap or step-off in the palate suggests a maxillary fracture. A laceration or step-off at the upper alveolar ridge suggests a mid-face fracture, while such injuries at the lower alveolar ridge suggest a mandible fracture. Broken or loose teeth may be identified, as may tongue or lip lacerations (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Dental injury'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-repair-of-tongue-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and repair of tongue lacerations&quot;</a>). A mandible fracture may be present if the patient complains that mouth-opening is restricted or abnormal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68465 \">figure 15</a>). Ecchymosis or swelling around the chin or preauricular area is associated with a mandible fracture, as is numbness of the chin or teeth that is present immediately following trauma. Numbness that develops a few days later is more likely to stem from local edema. Palpation of the mandible both externally and within the oropharynx (performed with appropriate caution &#8210; some examiners place gauze between the upper and lower teeth) may reveal tenderness, crepitus, or step-off, any of which suggest a mandible fracture.<br/><br/>In alert patients, the tongue blade test is helpful for determining the presence of a mandible fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. It is performed by having the patient bite down firmly on a tongue depressor placed between the upper and lower molars and then having the clinician twist the blade. A fracture is highly unlikely if the patient is able to maintain a strong bite such that the blade cracks when twisted. The test is performed on both sides of the mouth. In two prospective studies of emergency department patients, including over 100 with mandible fractures, the reported sensitivity of the test was 95 and 96 percent, and the specificity 64 and 68 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36</a>]. One study reported a negative predictive value for mandible fracture of greater than 92 percent for patients able to crack the tongue blade on both sides of their mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].<br/><br/>External lacerations in the parotid area raise suspicion for disruption of Stensen's duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 7</a>). The opening of the duct, which lies in the inner wall of the cheek opposite the second upper molar, should be examined for bleeding while the gland is compressed. If blood is expressed from the duct or the severed ends of the duct are identified within a facial wound, specialized repair over a stent will be required to prevent formation of a cutaneous fistula. Cranial nerve V should also be tested as injuries may occur from soft tissue lacerations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ears</strong> &ndash; The external ear is examined for lacerations and hematomas. Postauricular ecchymosis (Battle sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69660 \">picture 5</a>), while highly suggestive of the presence of a basilar skull fracture, does not develop until two or more days following trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skull-fractures-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skull fractures in adults&quot;, section on 'Basilar skull fracture'</a>.)<br/><br/>After examining the external ear, the clinician performs otoscopy to evaluate the integrity of the external canal and to look for hemotympanum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75382\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75382 \">picture 6</a>) and otorrhea. Clear fluid draining from the ear following trauma may be cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).To assess this, the clinician can place a drop of the fluid onto filter paper. A rapidly advancing &quot;halo&quot; or ring of clear fluid around red blood defines a positive test. This quick bedside test has reasonable sensitivity in a laboratory setting provided the mix is approximately equal parts blood and CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Of note, the halo test does <strong>not</strong> differentiate among CSF, saline, saliva, and other clear fluids and has not been formally studied in a clinical setting.<br/><br/>Urine dipsticks have also been used to determine the presence of CSF by checking for the presence of glucose. However, this approach is <strong>not</strong> reliable because both blood and CSF contain glucose. When in doubt about the presence of a CSF leak, it is best to obtain urgent neurosurgical consultation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CSF leaks can be detected by beta2-transferrin electrophoretic examination, high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT), magnetic resonance cisternography with contrast, and surgical exploration; however, these methods can be timely, costly, or invasive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper face</strong> &ndash; Fractures of the forehead often involve the frontal sinuses.

Therefore, simple radiographs of the mandible are less sensitive for detecting fractures than panoramic radiographs (ie, Panorex) and can miss fractures of the condyle. If available, Panorex imaging can be used for isolated mandibular fractures, dental fractures, or fractures of the alveolar ridge. CT accurately detects mandible fractures. A decision rule to reduce the need for imaging of suspected mandible fractures has been developed, but further study, including prospective validation, is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Although traditional teaching states that mandible fractures occur in pairs because of the bone's structure, a case series of 102 mandible fractures assessed by CT found that 42 percent involved a single fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE INJURIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with multiple injuries are resuscitated according to standard trauma protocols.

They can sit leaning forward and may be allowed to suction themselves. Should spinal protection be required, the backboard may be tilted in a manner that reduces the risk of aspiration.</p><p>When endotracheal intubation is indicated, clinicians should anticipate difficulty in patients with heavy bleeding or evidence of a hematoma extending into the neck or supraclavicular region. Simultaneous preparation for oral intubation and cricothyrotomy (ie, double set-up) is prudent in such cases.

When such injuries do occur, symptoms and signs may be subtle or absent and the diagnosis delayed, possibly resulting in permanent disability. Signs of injury may include a bruit or thrill, expanding hematoma, pulse deficit, or focal or lateralizing neurologic deficits.

Such patients can be provided with a referral for outpatient specialty follow-up three to five days following the injury.</p><p>Perforated septal injuries may be identified during patient evaluation. They should be referred to an otolaryngologist for outpatient management within three to five days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Midface</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The zygoma is often fractured during severe facial trauma because of its prominence and superficial location. Displacement can be significant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55561\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55561 \">figure 13</a>). Fractures to the adjacent portion of the maxilla, orbit, and sphenoid bones frequently accompany zygoma fractures due to their close structural relationship. Many of these midface fractures require operative repair, and surgical referral should be obtained. </p><p>The so-called &quot;tripod&quot; fracture of the midface involves the zygoma, lateral orbit, and the maxilla. These tripod fractures, which are typically caused by a direct blow, are often displaced and require operative repair. If left untreated, the area may sink posteriorly and inferiorly, giving an unacceptable appearance of facial asymmetry emphasized by the inferior position of the orbit and malar flattening.</p><p>On the initial physical examination, complex midface fractures involving the zygoma and adjacent structures (particularly the anterior wall of the maxilla) may manifest as a large contusion over the cheekbone, enophthalmos, or malocclusion, due to displacement of the upper teeth.</p><p>Complex fractures of the midface are classified using the LeFort system, although many complex fractures defy such classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55687\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55687 \">figure 16</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>LeFort I injuries involve a transverse fracture through the maxilla above the roots of the teeth. The injury may be unilateral or bilateral. Patients may complain of malocclusion. The clinician may detect motion in the maxilla when the upper teeth are grasped and rocked, while the forehead is held stationary with the other hand.</p><p>LeFort II injuries are typically bilateral and involve fractures that extend superiorly in the midface to include the nasal bridge, maxilla, lacrimal bones, orbital floor, and rim. The fracture lines are shaped like a pyramid. When examined, the nasal complex moves as a unit with the maxilla when the teeth are grasped and rocked, while the forehead is held stationary.</p><p>LeFort III injuries (ie, craniofacial dissociation) involve fractures that result in discontinuity between the skull and the face. The fractures begin at the bridge of the nose and extend posteriorly along the medial wall of the orbit and the floor of the orbit, and then through the lateral orbital wall and the zygomatic arch. Intranasally, they extend through all the lesser bones to the base of the sphenoid and are frequently associated with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. According to the results of computed tomography (CT) imaging studies that show the full extent of fracture comminution, true LeFort III injuries are rare.</p><p>Significant trauma to the central midface caused by a motor vehicle crash or forceful direct blow may fracture the deep nasoethmoid complex, orbital walls, and maxilla without creating a formal LeFort pattern. While patients with isolated nasal bridge injuries from less severe trauma do not need radiographs, imaging should be obtained when midface fractures are a concern. CT is the initial test of choice in this setting.</p><p>Fractures to the central portion of the ethmoid bone (cribriform plate) are likely to be associated with a CSF leak and commonly result in anosmia (loss of smell), due to injury to the first cranial nerve. If possible, patients with a CSF leak should have the head of their bed elevated 40 to 60 degrees. Head elevation minimizes intracranial pressure purportedly by decreasing arterial inflow and increasing venous outflow, thereby allowing the leak to seal.</p><p>Often, patients with significant midface trauma are treated with antibiotics. However, such treatment is frequently not indicated, and most studies supporting such treatment involve small case series. Prophylactic antibiotics are appropriate for patients with significant midface trauma associated with one or more open contaminated wounds. Neurosurgeons should be consulted for patients with CSF leaks, although many such leaks will resolve spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. For more complex patients with underlying comorbidities that may place them at greater risk of infection, we suggest consultation with an infectious disease specialist to determine the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H172458237\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inpatient management in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Antibiotics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by specific pathogens in adults&quot;, section on 'Basilar skull fracture and cerebrospinal fluid leak'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral lacerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Through-and-through lacerations of the mouth should be closed in layers, beginning with the intraoral mucosa and working outward toward the skin. Following closure of the mucosal layer, copious irrigation of the external wound is performed to remove debris and bacteria that otherwise would be incorporated into the wound. Most authorities use new equipment and a new pair of sterile gloves for repair of the skin. Prophylactic antibiotics are necessary in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-intra-oral-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of intra-oral lacerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The integrity of the parotid (Stensen's) or submandibular (Wharton's) ducts should be assessed before any laceration is repaired whenever the laceration occurs close to these structures. Ductal lacerations should be evaluated by a facial surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Examination of specific body parts'</a> above.)</p><p>Tongue lacerations are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-repair-of-tongue-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and repair of tongue lacerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Dental injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dental trauma may occur with or without other facial injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68403\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68403 \">figure 17</a>). Tooth fractures are classified by the Ellis system:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class I fractures involve only the enamel of the tooth, are not painful, and can be evaluated on an outpatient basis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class II fractures expose the yellow dentin and may be painful. These injuries are suitable for outpatient care. They may be dressed. This is done by covering the exposed area with calcium hydroxide (taking care that the tooth is dry to ensure adherence) and then wrapping dental foil around the tooth to create a protective barrier. Advise patients to drink liquids and avoid solids until they are seen by a dentist in follow-up to avoid losing the dressing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class III fractures expose the dental pulp, seen as a red line or dot, and are exquisitely painful. They require evaluation by a dentist or endodontist within 48 hours.</p><p/><p>Trauma to the mouth of sufficient force can avulse teeth from their sockets. Major trauma patients, particularly those who are intoxicated, neurologically impaired, or require cervical spine immobilization should have fully or partially avulsed teeth removed from the mouth to prevent aspiration. Teeth should be removed if this can be done easily with gloved fingers. Teeth that would require instruments for removal are left in place.</p><p>When they cannot be immediately reimplanted, teeth are stored in a culture media or milk. These storage solutions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of dental injuries in children&quot;, section on 'Permanent tooth injury'</a>.)</p><p>In a critically ill trauma patient, avulsed teeth are among the lowest priorities and should be replanted only if the care of other injuries allows and there is no risk of aspiration if the tooth loosens.</p><p>In patients with minor trauma and no risk of aspiration, avulsed teeth should be reimplanted as soon as possible. Ideally, a dentist, oromaxillofacial surgeon, or comparable specialist should perform the reimplantation, but often this is not possible. To perform reimplantation, disturb the socket as little as possible, gently rinse the tooth (the root should not be wiped), and replace it in the socket, where it generally &quot;clicks&quot; into place. If the tooth is only partially avulsed, extruded, or laterally luxated, it should not be removed. Rather, it should be reimplanted or relocated. Intruded teeth should not be manipulated.</p><p>Reimplantation can be painful and may require local anesthesia with a regional dental block. Alternatively, the area of a single socket may be anesthetized by placing approximately 0.5 mL of 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> into the buccal sulcus and gum on the outer side of the alveolar ridge. After reimplantation, the tooth requires stabilization with an acrylic splint or wiring to adjacent teeth. The studies available to determine the best approach to the management of dental trauma are limited, and the approach described here is based upon observational data and expert opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p>Replanted teeth may not &quot;take&quot; acutely, and weeks may be needed to determine whether reimplantation was successful. The length of time out of the socket appears to play an important role. In one small retrospective study, 66 percent of teeth reimplanted within one hour were radiographically healed and functionally normal after five years, while 80 percent of teeth reimplanted after three hours demonstrated signs of inflammation and bone resorption after the same period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. </p><p>Patients involved in major trauma, particularly those who are intoxicated or have sustained a neurologic injury, may not recall aspirating a tooth. Clinicians should look carefully for missing avulsed teeth and a chest x-ray should be obtained if they are not found. If the tooth is below the diaphragm on the radiograph, retrieval is unnecessary. Teeth lodged in a bronchus or the esophagus require bronchoscopic or endoscopic retrieval. Aspirated teeth result in pulmonary abscess formation unless removed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fractures through the alveolar ridge may result in a group of teeth being dislodged and out of position, often bent inward. These teeth require stabilization with wire, arch bars, or acrylic splinting after fracture reduction. Such stabilization is often complex and generally requires the urgent involvement of an oral surgeon. Patients with a displaced alveolar ridge fracture should not eat or drink until the fracture is reduced. Prophylactic antibiotics (eg, penicillin) are given for open fractures. Depending upon the severity of injury, follow-up with a dentist or oromaxillofacial surgeon is necessary for patients with dental trauma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt trauma to the ear may cause hematoma formation in the subperichondrial potential space. Such hematomas are the prelude to the development of &quot;cauliflower&quot; (or wrestler's) ear and should be drained. Ear lacerations often involve the cartilage and require precise repair. Antibiotic prophylaxis may be needed. The management of ear trauma is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-auricular-hematoma-and-cauliflower-ear\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of auricular hematoma and cauliflower ear&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-auricle-ear-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of auricle (ear) lacerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporomandibular joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) may result in soft tissue injury, fracture, or dislocation. Injuries to the meniscus or collateral ligaments can cause malposition of the jaw. Meniscal injury can impair TMJ translation, resulting in clicking or popping or the inability to open the mouth fully. Patients without a fracture or dislocation but with pain and difficulty opening their mouth should be instructed to limit their diet to soft foods and avoid yawning or straining to open their mouths wide. Follow-up with an oral surgeon with expertise in TMJ pathology is recommended within two weeks.</p><p>Anterior dislocation of the TMJ can occur after any action that involves opening the mouth wide, including yawning, laughing, kissing, or singing. Once the condyle is dislocated, the muscles of mastication spasm, preventing spontaneous reduction. TMJ dislocations more often involve both condyles but may be unilateral. The patient typically complains of being unable to close his or her mouth. In unilateral dislocation, the jaw is rotated laterally, away from the affected side. Garbled speech and drooling are often present. If the dislocation occurred as a result of trauma, a plain x-ray should be obtained before reduction is attempted to determine the presence of a fracture. The reduction of TMJ dislocations is discussed separately.

Look for any structural asymmetry (observe from more than one perspective), gross discrepancies in motor function, and signs of internal injury (eg, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] rhinorrhea, septal hematoma, peri-auricular ecchymosis). Subtle discrepancies can be important. As an example, differences in the relative positions of the eyeballs may help to diagnose orbital fractures. Palpate the bony prominences of the face feeling for focal tenderness, step-off, crepitus, and abnormal motion (eg, midface instability). Facial nerve motor function (CN VII) and sensation (CN V1, V2, V3) should be assessed. Findings associated with specific injuries are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'General examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Examination of specific body parts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential airway compromise is suggested by dysphonia, edema of the oropharynx, or stridor. Supine trauma patients with heavy bleeding or oral debris from facial injuries are at risk of aspiration and airway compromise. Blood and debris must be removed with aggressive suctioning (two suction devices may be needed) and by hand if necessary. It is best to secure the airway early with tracheal intubation if it is felt to be at risk of obstruction. Facial fractures may impede the performance of bag-valve-mask ventilation; back-up airway techniques and adjuncts should be prepared and available. Patients with severe oropharyngeal bleeding who do not require spinal immobilization should be allowed to assume a position of comfort. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Airway'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-the-adult-with-direct-airway-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in the adult with direct airway trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding is usually managed with direct pressure. If that fails, hemostasis can be achieved by urgent suturing of the laceration or ligation of the relevant vessel. Tissue ischemia is highly unlikely due to the extensive anastomoses among facial arteries. Great care should be taken not to clamp or tie structures blindly because injury to nerves or ducts can result. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To optimize cosmesis, bite wounds and wounds with gross contamination or embedded foreign bodies should be cleaned, debrided, and definitively repaired as soon as possible. Antibiotics are not required for simple facial wounds; wounds likely to warrant antibiotics are described in the text.
