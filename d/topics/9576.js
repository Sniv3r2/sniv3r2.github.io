The goal of lower extremity joint protection is to avoid overloading vulnerable <span class=\"nowrap\">joints/tissues,</span> prevent recurrent sprains and strains, reduce pain and inflammation, and thus preserve joint integrity.</p><p>Joint protection is best achieved through patient education, behavior modification, energy conservation; in selected cases, use of orthotic devices, splints, adaptive devices; and, in the case of the lower extremities, proper footwear. Conservative care includes preventive care, and joint protection is a fundamental way to provide preventive joint care.</p><p>Joint protection for the lower extremities will be reviewed here. An overview of joint protection and joint protection for the upper extremities and neck are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-joint-protection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of joint protection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-protection-program-for-the-upper-limb\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint protection program for the upper limb&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-protection-program-for-the-neck\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint protection program for the neck&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF JOINT PROTECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principles of joint protection are derived from the simple, practical application of proper body mechanics, posture, and positioning of joints. Joint protection reduces local joint stress and preserves joint integrity. Guiding the patient to perform a task in a manner that puts less stress on joints is generally preferred to prohibiting the task [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The principles of joint protection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respect pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce excess body weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Demonstrate proper posture and body mechanics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use minimum force for energy conservation and injury prevention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participate in regular exercise, as tolerated, to maintain function, range of motion, strength, and balance</p><p/><p>These principals and their application are discussed in detail in the sections below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Respect pain</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain may be interpreted as a signal for the patient to modify or avoid the activities that cause pain. In the acute phase of pain (less than 12 weeks since onset), respecting pain and minimizing activities that cause an excessive load on the joint is a useful strategy. In chronic pain states (more than 12 weeks since onset), it is important to also recognize that loss of strength, flexibility, coordination, and function create significant cognitive and psychological distress that may hinder long-term recovery. In this instance, the recovery may require gradual reconditioning with the guidance of clinicians, physical therapists, personal trainers, and pain psychologists. In this latter state of chronic pain, the patient needs to make regular movement part of the daily regimen, not contingent on whether or not there is pain ongoing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should warm up before doing exercises or vigorous activity. A warm up should consist of 5 to 10 minutes of gentle joint range of motion exercises or any gentle activity that increases the heart rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We advise that patients should choose footwear with comfort, support, and utility in mind, and that patients should not wear shoes that cause pain or fatigue. Individualized assessment is an important component of a joint protection intervention. If a shoe hurts, it is likely placing excessive stress on the joints and soft tissues, which could contribute to injury and long-term problems, especially in arthritic joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The history of past shoe wear may be important for women with current foot pain. Women who wore &quot;good shoes,&quot; compared with women who wore &quot;average shoes,&quot; in the past were 67 percent less likely to report hindfoot pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This study, using data from the Framingham (MA) study, defined &quot;good shoes&quot; as low-risk shoes, including athletic and casual sneakers with rigid heel counters, fixation, or firm, non-flexible soles. &quot;Average shoes&quot; included those with hard or rubber soles, special shoes, and work boots. &quot;Poor shoes&quot; included those that lack support and sound structure, including high-heeled shoes, sandals, and slippers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A systematic review found evidence that special shoes and orthoses may benefit patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, patient dissatisfaction with footwear often resulted in decreased usage, while participation in the design stage of specialized footwear improved usage, decreased pain, and improved foot health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The following issues should be noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patient acceptance of footwear is needed for clinical benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Appropriate shoes should provide support and comfort for the weightbearing foot, with room for the toes to extend fully and to broaden out during weightbearing. A certified pedorthist can construct custom shoes, with a doctor's prescription, for patients with structural foot deformities. In addition, orthotics may be obtained from a medical equipment company with the advice and assistance of a treating physical therapist or podiatrist. If a patient has a structural deformity that may require custom-made orthotics, then it is advised that the patient pursue a podiatry consultation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Proper fit should be determined by having the foot size measured while standing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Attention should be given to wearing shoes with an appropriate heel height (usually a one-inch heel). They should fit the description of a &quot;good shoe,&quot; as specified above, and should be checked often for signs of wear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cushion soles with shock absorbing material should be used if walking or working on concrete.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Running shoes, walking shoes, or aerobics shoes are more supportive and comfortable to the flexible or arthritic foot. Good running shoes and arch supports are important. It is important to remember to replace running or walking shoes regularly. Running and walking shoes should be replaced every 300 to 500 miles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A metatarsal pad or bar can be used to relieve pressure or pain at the forefoot. A certified orthotist can make a custom fit orthotic with a metatarsal pad. A metatarsal pad helps unload the metatarsal heads, which can decrease pain at the forefoot. Metatarsal pads can be purchased over the counter or online; however, patients with special footcare needs or foot deformities may need to have a custom fit metatarsal pad made by an orthotist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Footwear that is especially designed for a particular sport should be used for participation in that activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who do not respond with a reduction in pain to the more simple measures described above, we recommend evaluation by a podiatrist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Orthoses can provide needed support and positioning assistance. We suggest consultation with an experienced professional regarding the choice of an orthosis, whether having it custom-made or obtaining it over-the-counter. For patients with structural foot deformities, custom orthoses can be fit and made by a certified orthotist, physical therapist, podiatrist, or a certified pedorthist, with the appropriate prescription from a podiatrist (or physical therapist). Orthoses should then be used in both sports shoes and everyday shoes.</p><p/><p>There is no consensus on the choice of foot orthoses used for managing pathology in the rheumatoid foot, although there is strong evidence that foot orthoses do reduce pain and improve functional ability. The type of foot orthoses used range from simple cushioned insoles to custom-made rigid cast devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2008 systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] found that, for people diagnosed with RA, custom-made foot orthoses, which can be made by a certified orthotist, pedorthist, or physical therapist with a prescription or by a podiatrist, are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>More effective than no intervention for reducing rear foot pain up to 30 months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not more effective than a standard intervention of supportive shoes or non-custom foot orthoses for reducing metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint pain or for improving function after six weeks or three months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with joint <span class=\"nowrap\">hypermobility/laxity</span> should be particularly careful to protect the ankles and feet. Sprains and strains can increase joint instability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If synovitis or synovial effusion is present, joint aspiration and injection, where indicated clinically, can result in a more rapid response to physical therapy and joint protection principles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The weightbearing load should be distributed over stronger joints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larger surface areas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should avoid overloading the joints and should instead use the muscles that surround the joint. For example, the thigh muscles can be used to rise from a chair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods. Straightening the knees or standing up at least every 30 minutes during prolonged periods of sitting relieves pressure and stretches tight muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduce excess body weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We advise that patients maintain an appropriate weight to reduce stress on the knees, feet, and ankles. Increased body mass index is associated with onset and progression of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee (but not the hip) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, the combination of modest weight loss plus moderate exercise provides improvements in overall pain and performance measures of mobility in older overweight obese adults with knee OA compared with either intervention alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The following points should be reviewed with patients, depending upon their individual activities or symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip and buttock region pain may result from bending at the waist while the knees are locked straight. Persons with joint laxity are more likely to bend improperly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F75222\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75222 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When lifting heavy loads, it is better to bend at the knee and not at the waist and to avoid allowing both knees to pass over the toes. Lifting should be done with thigh muscles, straightening the knees first then the back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64062\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64062 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient's job or task requires prolonged standing at one site, placing a 12-inch long 2X4-inch board on the floor, then placing one foot on and off of it at intervals, alternating feet, can reduce lower limb fatigue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56903\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56903 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twisting should be avoided while carrying a heavy load, which should be held close to the body. It is better to move the body as a unit when carrying a heavy load to avoid excessive stress and strain on the low back, hips, knees, and ankles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74843\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74843 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55361\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55361 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When lifting heavy objects, the load should be kept centered in front of the body. Carrying heavy items in one hand at the side of the body should be avoided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76812\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76812 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knee pain can be caused by foot disorders; the entire lower leg should be evaluated when investigating this complaint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should modify or avoid knee-twisting dance steps or exercises.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should try to sit with lumbar support and with feet in contact with the ground. Sitting with a leg folded under or in a crossed-legged position should be avoided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70254\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70254 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The knee should not pass over the toes when squatting. This helps prevent placing excessive stress on the knee joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54894 \">picture 8</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is preferable to avoid loading the knee joint at angles greater than 45 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For example, deep knee squats and squatting for prolonged periods of time should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ergonomic <span class=\"nowrap\">assessments/interventions</span> are very useful in preventing work-related injuries and play an important role in joint protection. Results from a pilot study on an ergonomic assessment tool for arthritis (EATA) indicate that it is a feasible and a comprehensive process for identifying ergonomic job accommodations for patients with inflammatory arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Minimum force</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be advised to use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job.

Excessive medial joint loading of the knee occurs with a high adduction moment, which increases as the knee becomes more varus. Patients with a varus alignment demonstrate a higher incidence of medial compartment OA. Therefore, varus alignment is widely accepted as an indicator of the extent of medial compartment loading. A 1 percent increase in adduction moment increases the risk of OA progression by 6.46 times and is a useful research measure for evaluating treatment strategies designed to slow disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Valgus knee bracing: One conservative nonsurgical intervention, which can reduce the adduction moment at the knee for patients with medial compartment OA, is the use of a valgus knee brace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Adjustable valgus bracing is effective in reducing medial compartment load and improved pain in a group of patients with knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A gait analysis study with 40 subjects with medial knee OA found that wearing shoes increases medial knee joint load, compared with walking barefoot, and that the use of a cane significantly reduces medial knee loading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

When selecting a specific cycling modality, it is important to ensure that the exercise does not increase pain and that the person using a recumbent or upright bike can get on and off safely. The choice of modality depends upon several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, upright cycling at both high and low intensity levels is usually safe and effective; it can help improve function, gait, and aerobic capacity, and reduce pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In individuals with functional deficits in performing sit to stand and step-ups, and those who have mobility limitations, a recumbent bike should be considered. Additionally, a recumbent bike is preferred following repair of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and for those with anterior or posterior knee instability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In people with generalized or low back pain, the recumbent bike may be a better alternative because it provides much more support to the back and may be more comfortable. The recumbent bike is also considered a safer alternative to the upright bike during rehabilitation, due to ease of access because of the larger and lower seat, back support, and side rails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p/><p>Cycling minimizes stress to the knee, as forces generated at the knee are no greater for cycling than for walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Additionally, cycling results in lower tibiofemoral compressive forces compared with walking (forces comparable to bodyweight with cycling and 2.8 to 3.5 times bodyweight when walking at about 5 km [about 3 miles] per hour), while still improving general health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>In one study, findings suggested that riding the recumbent bike had a reduced knee extensor moment and may promote the use of the hip extensors, as the hip-extension moment was higher when compared with the upright bike [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This finding could translate to improvements in functional movements such as sit to stand and step-up. Another study determined that recumbent cycling was an effective specific training modality for the sit to stand and step up movements, particularly when used in the early rehabilitation process, when a person does not have the strength to perform the task [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition, the higher hip extensor moment and reduced knee extensor moment is an important consideration when rehabilitating the postop ACL patient or persons post-ACL or -posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury, as the upright cycling position was found to have higher anterior and posterior shear forces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb/abstract/39,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES FOR TASK-RELATED PAIN (OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES)</span></p><p>For patients:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/&amp;token=T5VTM5DVSWjP3p02ZUs6X0bbFkt9sbucMIHciyBDrYI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7763\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.webmd.com</a></p><p>Provides general information including: Ask the Expert, Medical Library, Message Boards &amp; More</p><p><a href=\"http://www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/patients/diseases_and_conditions/index.asp&amp;token=VsRj3prR5Y51WsaM1jqrERId/XuQKIS+N4WJbiv5O8jM4mQjB/Lw+mgG4c/stt4kQFOsmVf3tP/leukBbvVRIElrmH6bX1ket6vPtH6mflw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7763\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.rheumatology.org/practice/clinical/patients/diseases_and_conditions/index.asp</a></p><p>Written by rheumatologists</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2001-111/pdfs/2001-111.pdf&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsSVCz3ijzNMgrqx9+ObUafa0CtADC31BEeDpqIvUEmTFkL8CDMRuaDxcl7+rvUxvGA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7763\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2001-111/pdfs/2001-111.pdf</a></p><p>Ergonomics for farm workers</p><p><a href=\"http://orthopedics.about.com/&amp;token=t5hbqrJBrkh2PP3290l3qZwisQbXj9W2SoJBPGqhro769Bu+MT9aOZWRoMzM+BWT&amp;TOPIC_ID=7763\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://orthopedics.about.com/</a></p><p>Written by orthopaedists</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ccohs.ca/&amp;token=w8LauWtJpBMhpe2/t6zO0ETHmZJGfldrKotyUjn2qEM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7763\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.ccohs.ca</a></p><p>Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sammonspreston.com/&amp;token=GIUVbka3LyEq7RFK1kLoB8h3tKDxxIBD1X8AP4db0IbtGhKL1WVgeumLg0CPqc0j&amp;TOPIC_ID=7763\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.sammonspreston.com</a></p><p>A catalog of energy saving devices, adapted ADL equipment and splints</p><p><a href=\"http://www.arthritis.org/&amp;token=oMC3X1+WCiEAM8+ZRgy2kHbbFOfp7tg28bq8gUNcLvpA+dTBrfHMx9H3uzo/Hssr&amp;TOPIC_ID=7763\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.arthritis.org</a></p><p>Arthritis Foundation: Provides information and resources for people living with various forms of arthritis, including information on advocacy</p><p>For clinicians:</p><p>Human Factors and Ergonomics Society</p><p>Box 1369</p><p>Santa Monica, CA 90406</p><p>310-394-1811</p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.hfes.org/Security/Home&amp;token=sL+p+gWoM5K8OZ3TcR7z2dUOiMVqOVIPylc0md+sHbPdEf/jdvahoKR3Gu/qMHv5&amp;TOPIC_ID=7763\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">https://www.hfes.org/Security/Home</a></p><p>Applied Ergonomics (journal)</p><p>Elsevier Science Ltd.</p><p>Langford Lane</p><p>Kidlington</p><p>Oxford,OX5 1GB,UK</p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.elsevier.com/locate/apergo&amp;token=Mk3LloypdGK/j0vwrKJo67l4g/AV22aRwWuWKDQw0tgoH9Q/z02j2+S3KfQNdER3&amp;TOPIC_ID=7763\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.elsevier.com/locate/apergo</a></p><p>U.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The principles of joint protection are derived from the simple, practical application of proper body mechanics, posture, and positioning of joints. Guiding the patient to perform a task in a manner that puts less stress on joints is generally preferred to prohibiting the task. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Principles of joint protection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important for patients with any arthritic condition to understand that pain is usually an indicator that a particular activity is placing an excessive load on the joint; pain may thus be interpreted as a signal for the patient to modify or avoid the activity. Patients should warm up before doing exercises or vigorous activity. We advise that patients should choose footwear with comfort, support, and utility in mind, and that patients should not wear shoes that cause pain or fatigue. Individualized assessment is an important component of a joint protection intervention. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Respect pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We advise that patients maintain an appropriate weight to reduce stress on the knees, feet, and ankles. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Reduce excess body weight'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We advise that patients use good posture and proper body mechanics. These points should be reviewed with patients and should be individualized depending upon their particular activities or symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Posture and body mechanics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient should be advised to use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job. This not only protects the joints but also plays a role in energy conservation. Specific strategies should be individualized to the patients' activities and needs. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Minimum force'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular exercise is recommended to help maintain function, joint range of motion, strength, and balance. Patients requiring lower-limb joint protection may benefit from exercises such as stationary biking, walking, or aquatic exercise, and should participate in exercise activities on a regular rather than occasional basis. (See <a href=\"#H8247850\" class=\"local\">'Regular exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple resources are available to assist both patients and clinicians in strategies for joint protection. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Resources for task-related pain (occupational injuries)'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Sheon RP, Orr PM.
