Clinical trials have found that both pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic approaches are efficacious for panic disorder.

(See <a href=\"#H85592353\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85592311\"><span class=\"h2\">Theoretical foundation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive and behavioral theories generally conceptualize panic disorder as an acquired fear of bodily sensations, particularly sensations associated with autonomic arousal, in individuals with certain psychological and biological predispositions for the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23418139\"><span class=\"h3\">Panic attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>From an evolutionary standpoint, fear is a natural and adaptive response to threatening stimuli. However, an initial panic attack is often unjustified, or lacks an identifiable trigger, and hence represents a &ldquo;false alarm&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. After the occurrence of an unexpected panic attack, individual vulnerabilities such as neuroticism (or, emotionality) and anxiety sensitivity (or, beliefs that anxiety is harmful) seem to play a role in determining whether or not an individual then develops anxiety about further panic attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. This anxiety typically becomes acutely focused on somatic sensations associated with panic attacks. As an example, individuals with panic <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/agoraphobia</span> are particularly likely to become anxious during procedures that elicit sensations similar to those experienced during panic attacks, such as spinning in a circle, hyperventilating, and inhalations of carbon dioxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. These individuals also fear signals that reflect heightened bodily arousal when given false physiological feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and over-attend to heartbeat stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Potential reasons for a patient&rsquo;s acute focus upon bodily sensations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interoceptive conditioning, or conditioned fear of internal cues such as elevated heart rate, due to their association with intense <span class=\"nowrap\">fear/distress</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Low level somatic sensations become conditional stimuli such that early somatic symptoms of the anxious response elicit significant bursts of panic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Extensive research supports the robustness of interoceptive conditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] and the independence of interoceptive conditioned responses from conscious awareness of triggering cues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Hence, slight changes in somatic state that are not consciously recognized may elicit &ldquo;out of the blue&rdquo; panic attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catastrophic appraisals of the bodily sensations as signs of imminent death, loss of control, or going crazy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Persons with panic <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/agoraphobia</span> endorse strong beliefs that bodily sensations associated with panic attacks cause physical or mental harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], selectively over-attend to words that represent physical and mental threat (such as &ldquo;disease&rdquo; and &ldquo;insane&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]) and show particularly rapid processing of panic-related words [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p>Interoceptive conditioning and catastrophic appraisals lead the individual to become anxious in response to low level bodily sensations. The resultant anxious autonomic arousal intensifies the sensations and creates a reciprocating cycle of fear and sensation that builds into a panic attack. The perception of panic attacks as being &quot;out of the blue&quot; generates even further anxiety in the long term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The perceived uncontrollability of bodily sensations is likely to generate further anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Anxiety, in turn, increases one&rsquo;s vigilance to sensations that have become cues for panic. Thus, a maintaining cycle of panic and anxiety develops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panic-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H557839771\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoidance behaviors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avoidance behaviors, such as agoraphobia, are believed to maintain catastrophic beliefs about bodily sensations and interrupt natural extinction of conditioned fear of bodily sensations. Examples of avoidance include safety behaviors such as holding onto objects or persons due to fears of fainting, sitting and remaining still due to fears of heart attack, and moving slowly or searching for an escape due to fears of acting foolish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Avoidance also includes refusal to enter, or premature escape from, situations from which escape might be difficult or help unavailable in the event of panic-related sensations (such as driving, being far from home, and closed-in places). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=agoraphobia-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis#H897575\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Agoraphobia in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157308710\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals for whom CBT works best are generally highly motivated and value a problem-solving approach. CBT requires that the patient learns the skills of self-observation and of becoming a personal scientist, learns cognitive and behavioral coping skills, and learns to repeatedly practice the skills in anxiety-provoking contexts outside of the therapy setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Chronic life stress, or episodic stressful events, can interfere with CBT for panic <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/agoraphobia</span>. Relationship problems, job stress, financial hardship, and medical problems are examples of stressful situations that can both exacerbate panic symptoms and make it difficult for patients to engage in therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In these situations, medication may be an option.</p><p>Exposure, a behavioral intervention, may be contraindicated for persons with psychosis and other thought disorders or dementias, especially when behavioral avoidance of certain situations is adaptive for them. Since intensive exposure typically evokes high levels of anxiety at some point, it is generally not recommended when there are complicating medical conditions that make high levels of autonomic arousal potentially harmful (eg, certain arrhythmias or severe asthma). In some cases, a much more graduated exposure approach with ongoing monitoring of medical status may be an option. </p><p>CBT as a general approach is heavily aligned with European and North American values of an individual&rsquo;s capacity for change, open self-disclosure, independence, autonomy, and rational thinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Such values often are at odds with values of harmony, family, and spirituality that are deeply embedded in Asian, Latino, Arabic, African-American, and other cultures. Yet evidence suggests that CBT is effective with Latino and African-American groups, and it is not clear whether cultural adaptation of the therapy (eg, greater involvement of family members) significantly improves the outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85592318\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An in-depth, semi-structured or fully structured interview is the first step in establishing diagnostic features and the profile of symptomatic and behavioral responses in preparation for psychotherapy. One example is the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule &ndash; Fifth Edition (ADIS-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Data on the frequency, intensity, and duration of panic attacks, as well as details on avoidance behavior, are embedded within the ADIS-5. Such information is particularly helpful for tailoring treatment.

This instrument is very useful for establishing the situations to be targeted for exposure therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Albany Panic and Phobia questionnaire assesses fear and avoidance of activities that produce feared bodily sensations, as well as more typical agoraphobia and social situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p/><p>Behavioral avoidance tests, in which patients are asked to complete as many or as much as they can of a series of anxiety provoking tasks, are particularly useful ways to gauge treatment progress. Tasks may involve exercises that induce panic-like symptoms, such as spinning in a circle, running in place, or hyperventilating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. For agoraphobia, a behavioral test typically involves attempts at three to five situations that the patient identified before treatment as being from somewhat to extremely difficult (eg, driving two exits on a freeway, waiting in a bank line). Data from behavioral tests provide objective information that often differs from retrospective judgments as reported in self-report scales. Anxiety levels are rated at regular intervals throughout the behavioral tests, and actual distance or length of time is measured. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85592325\"><span class=\"h2\">CBT objectives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptomatic and behavioral foci of CBT are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Panic attacks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety about panic attacks and related physical sensations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of sensations, including activities that induce sensations (eg, exercise), and of situations in which panic attacks and related sensations are anticipated (eg, agoraphobia situations). </p><p/><p>The central focus is teaching patients a set of cognitive and somatic coping skills to effectively manage their anxiety as they conduct repeated exposure to feared situations and sensations. More specifically, patients are taught to become personal observers of their panic, anxiety, and avoidance. They learn to implement skills of cognitive restructuring to replace catastrophic appraisals with more evidence-based and coping oriented appraisals, and skills of breathing retraining or relaxation to control dysregulated physiology. Next, patients are encouraged to apply the cognitive and somatic skills during exposure to feared bodily sensations and situations. Through repeated exposure, patients learn that panic-related sensations are not harmful, that panic and anxiety can be managed or tolerated, and that they are able to accomplish tasks that were previously avoided. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85592332\"><span class=\"h2\">CBT techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157309048\"><span class=\"h3\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment begins with education about the nature of panic <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/agoraphobia,</span> the causes of panic and anxiety, and the way in which panic and anxiety are perpetuated by feedback loops among physical, cognitive and behavioral response systems. Specific descriptions of the psychophysiology of the fight-flight response are provided, as well as an explanation of the adaptive value of the various physiological changes that occur during panic and anxiety. The purpose of this education is to correct the common myths and misconceptions about panic symptoms (ie, beliefs about going crazy, dying or losing control) that contribute to panic and anxiety. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157309062\"><span class=\"h3\">Self-monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-monitoring is introduced in the first treatment session and is continued throughout the entire treatment. Ongoing self-monitoring functions in two ways: it provides ongoing assessment of change in panic, anxiety, and avoidance; and acts as a therapeutic tool to encourage objective self-awareness and increase accuracy in self-observation. Patients are asked to keep at least two types of self-monitoring records: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A panic attack record, to be completed as soon as possible after each panic attack; this record provides a description of cues, maximal distress, and symptoms, thoughts and behaviors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A daily mood record, completed at the end of each day, to record overall or average levels of anxiety or depression. Patients may additionally keep a daily record of daily activities or situations avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157309069\"><span class=\"h3\">Breathing retraining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breathing retraining is a commonly used somatic coping skill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. It is supported by evidence of respiratory abnormalities in panic <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/agoraphobia</span> possibly due to hypersensitive medullary CO<sub>2</sub> detectors, resulting in hypocapnia (ie, lower than normal levels of PCO<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>Traditional breathing retraining involves slow, abdominal breathing exercises. However, its value has been questioned in terms of the degree to which it actually corrects hypocapnic breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>Capnometry-assisted respiratory training (CART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>], in contrast to traditional breathing retraining, uses immediate feedback of end-tidal PCO<sub>2</sub> to teach patients how to raise their subnormal levels of PCO<sub>2</sub> (hyperventilation) and thereby gain control over dysfunctional respiratory patterns and associated panic symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, dizziness). CART has been shown to improve panic <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/agoraphobia</span> symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] in part through reducing hypocapnic breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], although another study showed equivalent effects using immediate feedback of end-tidal PCO<sub>2</sub> to either reduce or to increase CO<sub>2</sub> levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157309084\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle relaxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another somatic coping skill is progressive muscle relaxation, in which patients are trained over a number of weeks in 16-muscle groups, 8-muscle groups, 4-muscle groups and finally cue-control relaxation, at which point relaxation is used as a coping skill for practicing exposure to items from a hierarchy of anxiety provoking tasks. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157309091\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive restructuring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detailed self-monitoring of emotions and associated cognitions is used to identify specific beliefs, appraisals and assumptions. Relevant cognitions are categorized into types of errors, such as overestimations of risk of negative events, or catastrophizing of meaning of events. In labeling the type of cognitive distortion, the patient is encouraged to use an empirical approach to examine the validity of thoughts by considering all of the available evidence. Therapists use Socratic questioning to help patients make guided discoveries and question their anxious thoughts. Alternative hypotheses are generated that are more evidence-based. This approach is used to challenge surface level appraisals (such as &ldquo;my heart is racing dangerously too fast&rdquo;) and core beliefs or schemata (such as &ldquo;I am too weak to withstand distress&rdquo;) and develop more evidence-based appraisals and beliefs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157309099\"><span class=\"h3\">Exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vivo exposure involves repeated and systematic, real-life exposure to agoraphobic situations. It is intended to eventually reduce fear and avoidance of the situations through extinction of conditioned anxiety and correction of catastrophic misappraisals. Most often, in vivo exposure is conducted in a graduated manner, proceeding from the least to the most anxiety-provoking situations on an avoidance hierarchy, although there is some evidence to suggest that intensive or ungraduated exposure may also be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Critical to in vivo exposure is lessening the patient&rsquo;s reliance on safety signals and safety behaviors. Common safety signals or behaviors can include the presence of other people, empty or full medication bottles, seeking reassurance, or checking for exits. Reliance on safety signals and safety behaviors attenuate distress in the short term but may maintain excessive anxiety in the long term. They are replaced by effective use of cognitive restructuring and somatic coping skills, with care to ensure that the coping skills themselves do not become alternative safety behaviors. In vivo exposure can be conducted with therapist guidance, followed by self-directed exposures between sessions (to enhance generalization of learning and to limit the therapist&rsquo;s role as a safety signal).</p><p>In interoceptive exposure, the goal is to deliberately induce feared physical sensations a sufficient number of times and for long enough each time so that misappraisals about the sensations are disconfirmed and conditioned anxiety responding is extinguished. A standard list of exercises, such as hyperventilating and spinning, are used to establish a hierarchy of interoceptive exposures. Patients are encouraged to endure the sensations beyond the point at which they are first noticed, because early termination interferes with new learning. Interoceptive exposure usually is first conducted in-session with therapist guidance, followed by self-directed practice between sessions. Interoceptive exposure extends to routine activities that inherently induce somatic sensations (eg, caffeine consumption, exercise programs). Eventually, in vivo exposure is combined with interoceptive exposure, by deliberately inducing feared sensations in feared situations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157309120\"><span class=\"h3\">Relapse prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A final step of CBT is relapse prevention, in which patients are informed that despite their progress, recurrences of panic, anxiety or avoidance behavior are likely to occur in the future.
