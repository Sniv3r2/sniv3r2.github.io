As an example, the plasma sodium concentration is regulated by changes in water intake and excretion, not by changes in sodium balance. As will be described in the following sections, hyponatremia is primarily due to the intake of water that cannot be excreted, hypernatremia is primarily due to the loss of water that has not been replaced, hypovolemia represents the loss of sodium and water, and edema is primarily due to sodium and water retention. Understanding these basic principles is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>The general principles and disorders of water balance and sodium balance will be reviewed here. The causes and evaluation of hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypovolemia, and edema are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-adults-with-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of adults with hyponatremia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-edema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of edema in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following terms are commonly used when discussing disorders of water and sodium balance. Understanding what these terms represent is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37261016\"><span class=\"h2\">Total body water</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total body water (TBW) as a percentage of <strong>lean</strong> body weight varies with age. Approximate normal values are 80 percent in premature infants, 70 to 75 percent in term infants, 65 to 70 percent in toddlers, and 60 percent after puberty (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56512 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These values vary with the amount of fat since fat has a much lower water content than muscle. Thus, the TBW as a percentage of total body weight is lower in individuals with more fat. As examples, the TBW as a percentage of total body weight is lower in young adult females than in young adult males (50 versus 60 percent) and becomes progressively lower with increasing obesity or with loss of muscle mass.</p><p>The TBW has two main compartments: the <strong>extracellular fluid </strong>and the <strong>intracellular fluid</strong>, which are separated by the cell membrane. The relative size of the two main compartments varies with age. The extracellular fluid component is increased in infants and young children compared with older patients, which also contributes to the younger patients' greater TBW percentage of lean body weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56512 \">figure 1</a>). The cell membranes are freely permeable to water but not electrolytes and therefore help to maintain the different solute composition of the two compartments: sodium salts in the extracellular fluid, with chloride and bicarbonate being the major anions; and potassium salts in the intracellular fluid, with large macromolecular organic phosphates being the main anions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Extracellular fluid volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extracellular fluid component varies with age and is increased in infants and young children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56512 \">figure 1</a>). In normal adults, the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume constitutes approximately 33 to 40 percent of the TBW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] and is determined by the absolute amounts of sodium and water that are present in the ECF. For the remainder of this discussion, we will use 33 percent (one-third) with the remaining 67 percent (two-thirds) of the TBW being in the cells. (See <a href=\"#H24579285\" class=\"local\">'Intracellular fluid volume'</a> below.)</p><p>The ECF volume is regulated by alterations in urinary sodium excretion that are primarily mediated by variations in the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, which promote sodium retention, and the secretion of natriuretic peptides, which promote sodium excretion. (See <a href=\"#H96014906\" class=\"local\">'Regulation of effective arterial blood volume'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37261267\"><span class=\"h4\">Effective arterial blood volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hormonal changes that regulate the ECF volume are mediated by sensors in the renal afferent glomerular arterioles (for renin), carotid sinus (for sympathetic activity), and atria and ventricles (for natriuretic peptides) that respond to changes in pressure, not volume. In most settings, pressure and volume change in parallel with changes in sodium intake or with gastrointestinal or renal sodium losses due, for example, to diarrhea or diuretic therapy.</p><p>Loss of ECF volume can lead to a reduction in tissue perfusion. However, the ECF volume and tissue perfusion do not always change in the same direction. Two common examples are heart failure with edema and cirrhosis with ascites. In both disorders, the ECF volume is <strong>increased</strong>, but tissue perfusion is <strong>reduced</strong> due to a low cardiac output in most cases of heart failure and to vasodilation in cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-edema-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Heart failure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reduced effective arterial blood volume or reduced effective circulating volume are terms that have been used to describe the discrepancy between hypoperfusion and the increase in extracellular volume in heart failure and cirrhosis. In both disorders, decreased tissue perfusion activates sodium-retaining hormones, which increase the extracellular volume but, due to the underlying disease, do not normalize tissue perfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24579285\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracellular fluid volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal adults, the intracellular fluid volume constitutes approximately 60 to 67 percent of the TBW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Potassium salts are the main intracellular solutes, and the intracellular fluid volume is larger than the ECF volume because there are more potassium salts in the cells than sodium salts in the ECF. Changes in the intracellular fluid volume primarily occur when there are changes in plasma tonicity, resulting in water movement into or out of the cells. As described below, the intracellular and brain volumes usually increase with hyponatremia and decrease with hypernatremia (see <a href=\"#H37261099\" class=\"local\">'Plasma tonicity'</a> below). Water movement into or out of cells and possible neurologic symptoms are most pronounced with acute changes in the plasma sodium and often attenuate over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Osmolytes and cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Cerebral adaptation to hypernatremia'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37261092\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma osmolality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The plasma osmolality (Posm) is determined by the <strong>ratio</strong> of plasma solutes and plasma water. Most of the plasma solutes are sodium salts with lesser contributions from other ions (eg, potassium, calcium), glucose, and urea. The normal Posm is 275 to 290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>.</p><p>The plasma osmolality can be estimated from the following equation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-serum-osmolal-gap\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Posm &#160;= &#160;2 x [Na] &#160;+ &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">[glucose]/18</span> &#160;+ &#160;blood urea <span class=\"nowrap\">nitrogen/2</span>.8</p></div></div><p>The multiple of 2 accounts for the anions accompanying sodium, and the divisors of 18 and 2.8 for glucose and the blood urea nitrogen convert the values in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span>.

Water can freely cross almost all cell membranes and moves from an area of lower tonicity (higher water content) to an area of higher tonicity (lower water content).</p><p>The main difference between plasma tonicity and plasma osmolality is that plasma tonicity reflects the concentration of solutes that do not easily cross cell membranes (mostly sodium salts) and therefore affect the distribution of water between the cells and the ECF. By contrast, the plasma osmolality also includes the osmotic contribution of urea, which is considered an &quot;ineffective&quot; osmole since it can equilibrate across the cell membrane and therefore has little effect on water movement across the cell membrane. Ethanol is another osmole that rapidly enters cells and therefore has no tonicity.</p><p>The formulas used to estimate plasma tonicity are similar to those for the plasma osmolality with the one exception that the contribution of urea is not included:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Plasma tonicity &#160;= &#160;2 x [Na] &#160;+ &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">[glucose]/18</span> (if glucose is measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span></p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Plasma tonicity &#160;= &#160;2 x [Na] &#160;+ &#160;[glucose] (if glucose is measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p></div></div><p>The following examples illustrate the clinical importance of plasma tonicity and the difference between tonicity and osmolality:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremia is, in most cases, accompanied by a fall in plasma tonicity, which results in osmotic water movement from the ECF <strong>into</strong> the cells, including brain cells, and can contribute to the neurologic symptoms of hyponatremia. In this setting, both the plasma tonicity and plasma osmolality are reduced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypernatremia is accompanied by an increase in plasma tonicity, which results in osmotic water movement <strong>out of</strong> the cells, including brain cells, and can contribute to the neurologic symptoms of hypernatremia. In this setting, both the plasma osmolality and plasma tonicity are increased. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Hypernatremia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, urea accumulation in renal failure is associated with urea equilibration across the cell membrane. The plasma osmolality is increased by the excess urea, but the plasma tonicity is <strong>unchanged</strong> because urea is an <strong>ineffective</strong> osmole. As a result, there is little transcellular water movement. If, however, a patient with renal failure develops hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the changes in plasma tonicity will result in movement into and out of cells, respectively, similar to that seen in patients without renal failure. The plasma osmolality may still be elevated in patients with hyponatremia, but the plasma tonicity will be reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Urea equilibration across the blood-brain barrier occurs much more slowly than water equilibration. Thus, urea can transiently act as an <strong>effective</strong> osmole with respect to the brain when its plasma concentration changes rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The most common example of this phenomenon is the rapid fall in plasma urea concentration produced by hemodialysis in a uremic patient. In this setting, the removal of extracellular urea occurs more quickly than urea can equilibrate across the cell membrane. Thus, the plasma osmolality falls much more rapidly than the intracellular osmolality, which promotes osmotic water movement into cells. In the brain, the water shift can result in cerebral edema and acute neurologic dysfunction, changes that partially explain the dialysis disequilibrium syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome&quot;, section on 'Reverse osmotic shift'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Urea was previously used to treat cerebral edema and increased intraocular pressure, and is still occasionally used to treat hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. With rapid administration of urea, an osmotic gradient from plasma to brain develops, which promotes water movement out of the brain. Over several hours, urea is excreted in the urine with electrolyte-free water, which increases the serum sodium concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H165025474\"><span class=\"h2\">Dehydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dehydration is defined as a reduction in TBW below the normal level without a proportional reduction in sodium and potassium, resulting in a rise in the plasma sodium concentration. (See <a href=\"#H325761326\" class=\"local\">'Determinants of the plasma sodium concentration'</a> below.)</p><p>With primary loss of free water (as with unreplaced insensible losses or water loss in diabetes insipidus), the major biochemical manifestation is hypernatremia. Because water equilibrates across the cell membrane, about two-thirds of the water losses come from the cells and one-third from the ECF. Thus, 3 L of free water would have to be lost to produce the same reduction in ECF volume as the loss of 1 L of isotonic saline. Thus, signs of hypovolemia are <strong>not</strong> present unless there is a marked degree of free water loss. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Extracellular fluid volume'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24579285\" class=\"local\">'Intracellular fluid volume'</a> above.)</p><p>As described in the next section, hypernatremia does not usually occur in patients who have an intact thirst mechanism and access to water since stimulation of thirst can replace most of the water deficit. (See <a href=\"#H96014898\" class=\"local\">'Regulation of plasma tonicity'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96014928\"><span class=\"h1\">REGULATION OF WATER AND SODIUM BALANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The kidney regulates water and sodium balance independently since water can be taken in without salt and salt can be taken in without water (eg, pretzels or potato chips). Regulation of plasma tonicity and of the effective arterial blood volume involve different hormones, although there are some areas of overlap, such as the hypovolemic stimulus to the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). (See <a href=\"#H96014936\" class=\"local\">'Combined regulation of plasma tonicity and effective arterial blood volume'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96014898\"><span class=\"h2\">Regulation of plasma tonicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, it is the plasma tonicity (also called effective plasma osmolality) that is of primary importance in osmoregulation. Plasma osmolality measurement may include a high concentration of solutes that do <strong>not</strong> affect tonicity (eg, urea in renal failure or ethanol in intoxicated patients). These &quot;ineffective&quot; osmoles do not affect fluid movement into or out of cells unless there is a change in concentration that is more rapid than the time required for equilibration with the cells, as can occur with hemodialysis in patients with renal failure. (See <a href=\"#H37261099\" class=\"local\">'Plasma tonicity'</a> above.)</p><p>Changes in plasma tonicity are sensed by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. These receptors affect both water intake and water excretion by influencing thirst and the release of ADH, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51153\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51153 \">table 1</a>). ADH is the primary physiologic determinant of the rate of free water excretion. Its major renal effect is to augment the water permeability of the luminal membranes of principal cells in the cortical and medullary collecting tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], thereby promoting water reabsorption via osmotic equilibration with the hypertonic interstitium.</p><p>Signaling by ADH via the vasopressin 2 (V2) receptor initiates a sequence of intracellular events culminating in increased water permeability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F51077\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51077 \">figure 3</a>). Under the influence of ADH, preformed cytoplasmic vesicles that contain unique water channels (aquaporin-2) move to and fuse with the luminal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>], thereby allowing water to be reabsorbed down the favorable osmotic gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Once the water channels span the luminal membrane and permit osmotic water movement into the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], water is then rapidly returned to the systemic circulation across the basolateral membrane, which is both water permeable (even in the absence of ADH) and has a much greater surface area than the luminal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. When the ADH effect has worn off, the water channels aggregate within clathrin-coated pits, from which they are removed from the luminal membrane by endocytosis and returned to the cytoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>].</p><p>Thus, regulation of plasma tonicity is achieved by alterations in <strong>water balance</strong>. Suppression of ADH release is the primary protective mechanism against water retention and the development of hyponatremia, while thirst is the primary protective mechanism against water loss and the development of hypernatremia. The osmoreceptors are extremely sensitive, responding to alterations in the plasma tonicity of as little as 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. In humans, the osmotic threshold for ADH release is about 280 to 290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65195\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Below this level, there is little if any circulating ADH, and the urine should be maximally dilute with an osmolality below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>. Above the osmotic threshold, there is a progressive and relatively linear rise in ADH secretion. This system is so efficient that the plasma osmolality usually does not vary by more than 1 to 2 percent, despite wide fluctuations in water intake.</p><p>Persistent water retention resulting in hypoosmolality and hyponatremia occurs, with rare exceptions, only in patients with an impairment in renal water excretion due to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inability to suppress the release of ADH due to reduced effective arterial blood volume (as seen in true hypovolemia, heart failure, or cirrhosis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>or</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) or advanced renal failure in which water retention is largely independent of ADH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Water is continuously lost in sweat, and these water losses increase with higher environmental temperature. Avoidance of hyperosmolality and hypernatremia requires the intake and retention of exogenous water. This is achieved by increases in thirst and ADH release, which are induced by the elevation in plasma tonicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71817\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71817 \">figure 4</a>). Even though thirst is regulated centrally (including cortical areas that influence nonessential or social drinking), it is sensed peripherally as the sensation of a dry mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The cessation of thirst (satiety) is also mediated initially in the periphery by oropharyngeal mechanoreceptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>] that are stimulated by swallowing relatively large volumes of fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the response to hypotonicity, in which renal water excretion is of primary importance, <strong>thirst</strong> is the major defense against hypertonicity and hypernatremia. Hypernatremia generally will <strong>not</strong> occur in a patient with a normal thirst mechanism and access to water.

The mainstay of therapy in this disorder is fluid restriction and, in symptomatic patients, hypertonic saline. In patients who are not symptomatic, there may be a tendency to give isotonic saline. However, in most patients with SIADH, isotonic saline will <strong>not</strong> raise the plasma sodium and will often <strong>worsen</strong> the hyponatremia. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere, but why this occurs can be illustrated by the following scenario.

To raise the plasma sodium concentration with intravenous saline in patients with SIADH, the concentration of sodium plus potassium (ie, tonicity) of the infused solution must exceed the concentration of sodium plus potassium of the <strong>urine, not simply the plasma </strong>(see <a href=\"#H325761326\" class=\"local\">'Determinants of the plasma sodium concentration'</a> below). Since the urine osmolality is almost always above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> in hyponatremic patients with SIADH, urine electrolyte concentrations often equal or exceed the plasma sodium concentration so that isotonic saline alone is not an effective therapy.

The hormonal changes that occur allow the effective arterial blood volume and plasma tonicity to be maintained within a narrow range even in the presence of wide variations in intake from day to day. (See <a href=\"#H37261267\" class=\"local\">'Effective arterial blood volume'</a> above and <a href=\"#H37261099\" class=\"local\">'Plasma tonicity'</a> above.)</p><p>An important related issue is how balance (defined as intake and net losses being equal) is maintained with changes in water or sodium (or potassium) intake or excretion in normal subjects. There are two mechanisms by which this might occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A set point which acts to maintain the plasma sodium and potassium concentrations and the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume at specific levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A steady state in which intake and output are maintained at an equal level. In contrast to the set point mechanism, the plasma sodium, potassium concentration, and the ECF volume vary in the steady state to provide the signal that intake or urinary excretion (eg, with diuretic therapy) has changed.</p><p/><p>Water, sodium, and potassium balance are primarily achieved by maintenance of the <strong>steady state</strong> as illustrated by the following observations from different studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressively increasing sodium intake from 10 up to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/day</span> is associated with an appropriate equivalent increase in sodium excretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58458\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58458 \">figure 10</a>) that is mediated by increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide and decreased activity of the sodium-retaining renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F53243\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53243 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The signal that drives the hormonal response is a mild, and usually subclinical retention of sodium during the first few days before balance between intake and excretion is restored (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58458\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58458 \">figure 10</a>). The degree of volume expansion that occurs is proportional to the magnitude of the increase in sodium intake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A similar sequence occurs when sodium reabsorption is increased in primary aldosteronism: initial sodium retention, with the ensuing extracellular volume expansion providing the signal to increase sodium excretion back to the level of sodium intake (at least in part mediated by increased natriuretic peptide secretion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62044\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62044 \">figure 11</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The net effect of this phenomenon, which is called aldosterone escape, is reattainment of the steady state with no edema. Similar considerations apply to the plasma potassium concentration.

In a study evaluating the urinary responses to 100 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> per day (much higher than usual current dosing), the sodium wasting (ie, excretion greater than intake) ceased by day 4, and the potassium wasting ceased by day 10 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74940 \">figure 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Normal individuals can excrete more than 10 L of urine per day (and more than 400 mL per hour) and therefore will not develop hyponatremia unless water intake exceeds this value, which occurs most often in psychotic patients with primary polydipsia. Hyponatremia caused by massive water intake rapidly resolves as soon as water intake stops, provided that the ability to dilute the urine is intact. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Hyponatremia with a low serum osmolality'</a>.)</p><p>Persistent hyponatremia is associated with <strong>impaired water excretion</strong> that is most often due to an inability to suppress the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or to advanced renal failure. The two major causes of persistent ADH secretion are the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) and reduced effective arterial blood volume. The latter can be due to true volume depletion (eg, diuretics, vomiting, or diarrhea) or to decreased tissue perfusion in heart failure or cirrhosis. In the last two disorders, the severity of the hyponatremia parallels the severity of the underlying disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Hyponatremia with a low serum osmolality'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Predictor of adverse prognosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Predictor of adverse prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>Although water is retained in patients with hyponatremia, the degree of ECF volume expansion is not clinically important. The cell membranes are permeable to water, and approximately two-thirds of the excess fluid moves into the cells.</p><p>Hyponatremia due to water retention is typically associated with a reduction in plasma osmolality and tonicity (see <a href=\"#H37261099\" class=\"local\">'Plasma tonicity'</a> above). This initially creates an osmotic gradient that favors water movement from the ECF into cells and the brain. Water movement into the brain can lead to cerebral edema and potentially severe neurologic symptoms, particularly if the hyponatremia is acute. In addition, overly rapid correction of severe chronic hyponatremia can lead to potentially irreversible neurologic injury. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

This phenomenon can occur when hyperosmolality is induced by hyperglycemia or the administration of hypertonic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>. Because plasma tonicity is increased, these patients do <strong>not</strong> experience an increase in intracellular and brain volume caused by water movement into the cells. To the contrary, hypertonicity results in water movement out of the cells and the brain. The movement of water out of the brain with hypertonic mannitol provides the rationale for its use in the treatment of cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. The plasma sodium rises toward its baseline value as the hyperglycemia is treated or the mannitol is excreted in the urine.

However, urea readily diffuses into cells and is considered an <strong>ineffective osmole</strong>. The plasma tonicity (ie, effective plasma osmolality) is equal to the plasma osmolality minus the contribution of urea and is reduced in proportion to the reduction in plasma sodium. Thus, these patients can develop the manifestations of hyponatremia.

Hypovolemia is usually induced by salt and water losses that are not replaced (eg, vomiting, diarrhea, diuretic therapy, bleeding, or third-space sequestration). By contrast, unreplaced primary water loss, due to insensible loss by evaporation from the skin and respiratory tract or to increased urinary water loss due to diabetes insipidus, does <strong>not</strong> usually lead to hypovolemia, because water is lost disproportionately from the intracellular fluid compartment which contains approximately two-thirds of the total body water. (See <a href=\"#H24579285\" class=\"local\">'Intracellular fluid volume'</a> above.)</p><p>True hypovolemia due to fluid losses should be distinguished from decreased tissue perfusion in heart failure and cirrhosis in which cardiac dysfunction and systemic vasodilation, respectively, are the major hemodynamic abnormalities.

The effect on the plasma sodium concentration depends upon both the composition of the fluid that is lost and fluid intake.</p><p>In true hypovolemia due to vomiting, diarrhea, or diuretic therapy, the direct effect of fluid loss on the plasma sodium concentration depends upon the concentration of <strong>sodium plus potassium</strong> in the fluid that is lost (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71817\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71817 \">figure 4</a>). The rationale for including the potassium concentration is discussed above.

This represents the electrolytes contained in 500 mL of isotonic saline (sodium concentration 154 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span>. The loss of 500 mL of isotonic electrolytes will have no effect on the plasma sodium concentration. In addition, 500 mL of electrolyte-free water is excreted, which will raise the plasma sodium concentration.

The high urine sodium plus potassium concentration (which exceeds the sodium concentration of the plasma) is produced because thiazide diuretics act in the distal tubule and therefore do not interfere with urinary concentrating ability, which depends upon sodium chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle. The high ADH levels induced by the hypovolemia result in water reabsorption, high urine osmolality, and high urine electrolyte concentrations. Loop diuretics are much less likely to have this effect because they block sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which impairs the countercurrent mechanism. As a result, the urine osmolality will be closer to isosmotic despite high ADH levels, and the sodium plus potassium concentration will be less than the plasma sodium concentration since urea also contributes to the urine osmolality.

TBW as a percentage of total body weight is lower in young adult females than in young adult males (50 versus 60 percent) and becomes progressively lower with increasing obesity or with loss of muscle mass. The TBW has two main compartments: the extracellular fluid (ECF) and the intracellular fluid, which are separated by the cell membrane. (See <a href=\"#H37261016\" class=\"local\">'Total body water'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extracellular fluid (ECF) volume &ndash; The ECF component is greater in infants and young children compared with older patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56512 \">figure 1</a>). In normal adults, the ECF constitutes approximately 33 to 40 percent of the TBW in normal adults and is determined by the absolute amounts of sodium and water that are present in the ECF. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Extracellular fluid volume'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Effective arterial blood volume &ndash; The hormonal changes that regulate the ECF volume are mediated by sensors that respond to changes in pressure and tissue perfusion, not volume. In most settings, pressure and volume change in parallel with changes in sodium intake or with sodium losses. However, the ECF volume and tissue perfusion do not always change in the same direction. Two common examples are heart failure with edema and cirrhosis with ascites. In both disorders, the ECF volume is increased, but tissue perfusion is reduced. Reduced effective arterial blood volume is a term that has been used to describe the discrepancy between hypoperfusion and the increase in extracellular volume in heart failure and cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H37261267\" class=\"local\">'Effective arterial blood volume'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intracellular fluid volume &ndash; In normal adults, the intracellular fluid volume constitutes approximately 60 to 67 percent of TBW. Potassium salts are the main intracellular solutes, and the intracellular fluid volume is larger than the ECF volume because there are more potassium salts in the cells than sodium salts in the ECF. Changes in the intracellular fluid volume primarily occur when there are changes in plasma tonicity, resulting in water movement into or out of the cells. (See <a href=\"#H24579285\" class=\"local\">'Intracellular fluid volume'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plasma osmolality (Posm) &ndash; The Posm is determined by the ratio of plasma solute particles and plasma water. Most of the plasma solutes are dissociated sodium salts with lesser contributions from other ions (eg, potassium, calcium), glucose, and urea. The normal Posm is 275 to 290 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>. The plasma osmolality can be estimated (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-serum-osmolal-gap\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or measured. The plasma and ECF osmolality are the same as the intracellular osmolality since most cell membranes are freely permeable to water, which flows from areas of lower osmolality to those with higher osmolality. (See <a href=\"#H37261092\" class=\"local\">'Plasma osmolality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plasma tonicity &ndash; Plasma tonicity is the effective plasma osmolality, which is sensed by osmoreceptors and determines the transcellular distribution of water. Water can freely cross almost all cell membranes and moves from an area of lower tonicity (higher water content) to an area of higher tonicity (lower water content). The main difference between plasma tonicity and plasma osmolality is that plasma tonicity reflects the concentration of solutes that do not easily cross cell membranes (mostly sodium salts) and therefore affect the distribution of water between the cells and the ECF. The plasma osmolality includes the osmotic contribution of urea, which is considered an &quot;ineffective&quot; osmole since it can equilibrate across the cell membrane and therefore has little effect on water movement across the cell membrane. (See <a href=\"#H37261099\" class=\"local\">'Plasma tonicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dehydration versus hypovolemia &ndash; Dehydration is defined as a reduction in TBW below the normal level without a proportional reduction in sodium and potassium, resulting in a rise in the plasma sodium concentration (hypernatremia). Because water equilibrates across the cell membrane, about two-thirds of water losses come from the cells, and only one-third come from the ECF, thereby preserving effective arterial blood volume. Thus, signs of hypovolemia are not present in patients with dehydration unless there is a marked degree of free water loss. (See <a href=\"#H165025474\" class=\"local\">'Dehydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The kidney regulates water and sodium balance independently since water can be taken in without salt and salt can be taken in without water. Regulation of plasma tonicity and of the effective arterial blood volume involve different hormones, although there are some areas of overlap. (See <a href=\"#H96014928\" class=\"local\">'Regulation of water and sodium balance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osmoregulation (regulation of the plasma tonicity) is achieved by alterations in water balance. Suppression of ADH release is the primary protective mechanism against water retention and the development of hyponatremia, while thirst is the primary protective mechanism against water loss and the development of hypernatremia.

By contrast, a reduction in effective arterial blood volume due, for example, to volume contraction will activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. These hormonal changes result in both sodium retention and vasoconstriction, thereby maintaining the ECF and systemic blood pressure.
