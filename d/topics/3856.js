The most consistently observed histologic finding of GERD is the dilation of the intercellular spaces seen on transmission electron microscopy. Other histologic features include the presence of neutrophils and eosinophils, dilated vascular channels in papillae of the lamina propria, thickening of the basal cell layer with pale, distended squamous (&quot;balloon&quot;) cells, and elongation of the papillae of the epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56086\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56086 \">picture 5</a>).

Lymphocytic inflammation and dilated intercellular spaces occur deep in the epithelium, not at the luminal surface, and regenerative changes (basal cell hyperplasia, papillary elongation) are initiated prior to the development of surface necrosis.

The catheter type pH electrode is positioned 5 cm above the manometrically defined upper limit of the lower esophageal sphincter.

Other causes of dysphagia include esophageal <span class=\"nowrap\">rings/webs,</span> and impaired peristalsis due to an esophageal motility disorder. Slowly progressive dysphagia for solids with episodic esophageal obstruction is suggestive of a stricture or an esophageal cancer. Odynophagia may be due to infectious or medication-induced esophagitis. GERD can be distinguished from these conditions by esophageal manometry and upper endoscopy with biopsies of the esophagus. The differential diagnosis and evaluation of patients with dysphagia is discussed in detail separately.

GERD can be distinguished from these conditions by pH or pH-impedance testing. Patients with reflux hypersensitivity have normal acid exposure but a positive symptom association with acid or weakly acid reflux. Patients with functional heartburn have normal acid exposure and a negative symptom reflux association. Patients with functional dyspepsia have heartburn in one third of cases, but early satiety and postprandial fullness are the predominant symptoms.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complications. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated prevalence of GERD is approximately 10 to 20 percent of individuals in the Western world and less than 5 percent in Asia. However, prevalence estimates are limited by the assumption that heartburn <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regurgitation are the only indicators of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic symptoms of GERD are heartburn (pyrosis) and regurgitation.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of GERD can be based upon clinical symptoms alone in patients with classic symptoms.
