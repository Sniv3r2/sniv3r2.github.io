This entity had well-defined histologic and radiographic features and used to be an important cause of CKD, particularly in Australia, parts of Europe, and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>However, there was a marked decline in incidence subsequent to the withdrawal of phenacetin from the market and to legislation that made combined analgesics available only by prescription. Since these measures were virtually coincident, it is difficult to determine which measure caused the reduction in incidence.</p><p>Subsequent to the decline in incidence of analgesic nephropathy associated with phenacetin-containing and non-phenacetin-containing mixtures, many reports suggested that individual analgesic agents also cause CKD, although the underlying histology and radiographic features are not as well defined as for analgesic nephropathy associated with phenacetin-containing and non-phenacetin-containing mixtures. CKD due to single analgesic agents is thus less well documented.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology of, risk factors for, and pathogenesis of analgesic nephropathy associated with phenacetin-containing and non-phenacetin-containing mixtures, as well as CKD associated with single analgesic agents.

The analgesic mixtures contained centrally acting and potentially addicting agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caffeine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>, which may have led to excessive and habitual use of the analgesic drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50465 \">figure 1</a>). This is an important distinguishing feature from CKD associated with single analgesic agents.</p><p>The pathogenesis, epidemiology, and risk factors of classically described analgesic nephropathy are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H433994453\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analgesic nephropathy is characterized by renal papillary necrosis and chronic interstitial nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. It is caused by the chronic consumption of analgesics, particularly phenacetin in combination with other agents.</p><p>The renal damage induced by analgesics is most prominent in the medulla. The earliest changes consist of prominent thickening of the vasa recta capillaries (capillary sclerosis) and patchy areas of tubular necrosis; similar vascular lesions can be found in the renal pelvis and ureter, suggesting that the primary effect is damage to the vascular endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Later changes include areas of papillary necrosis and secondary cortical injury, with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and interstitial infiltration and fibrosis.</p><p>The mechanisms responsible for the renal injury are incompletely understood. Phenacetin is metabolized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and to reactive intermediates that can injure cells, in part by lipid peroxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These metabolites tend to accumulate in the medulla along the medullary osmotic gradient (created by the countercurrent system). As a result, the highest concentrations are seen at the papillary tip, the site of the initial vascular lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> potentiates the nephrotoxicity of both phenacetin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> by two possible mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> undergoes oxidative metabolism by prostaglandin H synthase to reactive quinoneimine that is conjugated to glutathione. If acetaminophen is present alone, there is sufficient glutathione generated in the papillae to detoxify the reactive intermediate. However, if acetaminophen is ingested with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, the aspirin is converted to salicylate, which becomes highly concentrated and depletes glutathione in both the cortex and papillae of the kidney. With the cellular glutathione depleted, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen then produces lipid peroxides and arylation of tissue proteins, ultimately resulting in necrosis of the papillae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F50465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50465 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suppress prostaglandin production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes. Renal blood flow, particularly within the renal medulla, is highly dependent upon systemic and local production of vasodilatory prostaglandins. Thus, this region, in the setting of combined aspirin and NSAID use, is more prone to ischemic damage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196805170\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and risk factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2250139100\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phenacetin-containing combination agents were almost certainly the most important cause of analgesic nephropathy. Analgesic nephropathy was common before phenacetin was removed from over-the-counter analgesics and before legislation was enacted making combined analgesics only available by prescription. Reports suggested that analgesic nephropathy was responsible for 1 to 3 percent of cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States as a whole, up to 10 percent in areas of North Carolina, and 13 to 20 percent in Australia and some countries in Europe (such as Belgium and Switzerland) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2250139106\"><span class=\"h3\">Phenacetin-containing combination agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By the time phenacetin was withdrawn from the market, phenacetin-containing combination analgesics had been implicated as a likely cause of analgesic nephropathy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective, 10-year study of women found that the incidence of a rise in the plasma creatinine concentration was 12 percent in those with heavy use of analgesic mixtures versus only 1.4 percent in nonusers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study compared 554 adults with newly diagnosed CKD (plasma creatinine concentration &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 132 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> with 516 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Renal function deteriorated in 12 (6.2 percent) of the patients, a relative risk of 6.1 compared with controls.

Decreased concentrating ability or a mild reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is observed after cumulative phenacetin intake of as little as 1 kg. In comparison, clinically evident renal disease requires a minimum intake of 2 to 3 kg each of phenacetin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. This requires six to eight years of a patient ingesting six to eight tablets (or approximately 1 gram) of phenacetin-containing compounds per day.

Some data suggest that the decrease in availability of all combination analgesic agents contributed to the decline in analgesic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6,7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,21</a>]. As an example, by comparison with the data cited above from Australia, in Belgium, where analgesic mixtures (including addictive substances such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a>) were more readily available, analgesic abuse still accounted for over 15 percent of cases of ESRD in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the northern part of the country, where analgesic nephropathy was most prevalent, the incidence was 12 percent in 1993 and decreased toward 4.5 percent in 2008 (Belgian Society of Nephrology [NBVN] registry data). In 1999, phenacetin-containing analgesic mixtures were banned, and manufacturers substituted single analgesics for analgesic mixtures. In 2001, analgesic mixtures became available only by prescription.</p><p>However, a long-term analysis of these data found no difference in the time trend of the age-specific incidence of ESRD between Australia and Belgium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>There have been a number of extensive reviews of the epidemiologic literature concerning the possible relationship between analgesic use and the development of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. All emphasize that the trials and studies examining this correlation are methodologically flawed. As a result, despite the collective evidence suggesting that chronic analgesic use is associated with CKD, causality, particularly that due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, has not yet been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In 2000, in order to address the uncertainty regarding the contributive role of non-phenacetin-containing mixtures, a committee of scientists, selected by regulatory authorities of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, and the pharmaceutical industry reviewed the available evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-analgesic-related-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].
