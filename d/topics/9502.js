IHH can occur either with normal olfaction (normosmic IHH) or with anosmia. This latter clinical presentation of IHH with anosmia is referred to as Kallmann syndrome (KS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pathogenesis, genetics, clinical presentation, and management of isolated GnRH deficiency (IGD or IHH) will be discussed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Other causes of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27285138\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with IHH often have clinical features that are present at birth (cryptorchidism, microphallus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biochemical evidence of low gonadotropins and sex steroids during the three to six months of the neonatal period referred to as &quot;mini-puberty&quot;). Some experts consider this to be a congenital disorder and refer to it in the literature as &quot;congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.&quot;<strong> </strong></p><p>However, more often, these neonatal features are absent and the age of onset or its precise etiology cannot be determined, and thus, the term &quot;idiopathic&quot; is used. Regardless of the terminology, this disorder is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), eg low inappropriately low or normal serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the setting of prepubertal levels of gonadal steroids. IHH is difficult to distinguish from the more common constitutional delay of puberty or functional hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (FHH) prior to age 18 years. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lack of endogenous hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) <span class=\"nowrap\">secretion/action</span> in patients with IHH cannot be proven by direct assay of GnRH in the portal circulation but can be reasonably inferred by two findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of any endogenous GnRH-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses during frequent blood sampling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56592\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56592 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typically, most IHH patients respond to exogenous GnRH when administered in a pulsatile regimen designed to mimic endogenous GnRH secretion (GnRH dose and frequency based upon a previous study of LH secretion in normal men) with robust gonadotropin secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55090\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55090 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This responsiveness demonstrates the intact anatomic and functional integrity of the gonadotrophs and the gonads in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, some IHH patients display atypical responses to pulsatile GnRH administration with evidence of some additional pituitary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> testicular defects. These include patients with IHH caused by inactivating mutations of the GnRH receptor, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) seen in syndromic cases due to genetic defects that impair anterior pituitary gonadotroph function (eg, mutations in <em>NROB1</em> that cause IHH and Gordon Holmes syndrome with mutations in the ubiquitination pathway genes), and some patients with <em>ANOS1</em> mutations. These patients can have a poor response to pulsatile GnRH administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372819954\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IHH (with or without anosmia) can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive manner. Increasingly, however, oligogenic inheritance (mutations in more than one IHH gene) is being recognized as contributing to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity that occurs within and across IHH families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The role of genetic testing is reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H2736497107\" class=\"local\">'Approach to genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>At first examination, more than two-thirds of IHH patients appear to be sporadic, ie, their IHH occurs in the absence of other family members being affected. However, the true familial nature of many cases becomes apparent only upon extensive questioning of the proband and other family members. Critical clues (such as a family history of anosmia; the absence of menstrual periods; delayed puberty; or the presence of skeletal, renal, or cardiac abnormalities associated with various genetic forms of gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] deficiency) are often not appreciated by close family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Thus, these apparently &quot;sporadic&quot; appearing cases can really represent familial pedigrees that display variable penetrance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> variable expressivity when questioned in more detail. To date, several genes have been implicated in the etiology of IHH. What follows are some of the most common genetic causes and their associated phenotypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2338806118\"><span class=\"h2\">Anosmic form of IHH (Kallmann syndrome [KS])</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genes that typically cause the anosmic form of IHH (Kallmann syndrome [KS]) include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>ANOS1</em></strong><strong> (formerly </strong><strong><em>KAL1</em></strong><strong>), X-linked recessive KS</strong> &ndash; <em>ANOS1</em>, located in the Xp22.3 region of the X chromosome was the first gene found to be mutated in KS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. This discovery, coupled with neuroanatomic observations in mice, demonstrated that GnRH deficiency in these patients result from impaired migration of GnRH neurons to the mediobasal hypothalamus during embryogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Unlike other hypothalamic neurosecretory neurons, GnRH neurons originate from the olfactory epithelium, which lies outside the developing brain, and then migrate into the developing hypothalamus during fetal life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Proper migration of these neurons is dependent upon the correct expression of anosmin-1, a 680-amino acid neural cell adhesion molecule-like protein, which is encoded by the <em>ANOS1</em> gene. In the rat, anosmin-1 promotes formation of collateral branches and enhances axonal branching of olfactory bulb neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mutations in <em>ANOS1</em> are either gene deletions or point mutations. The initial discovery of <em>ANOS1</em> as a causal gene for KS came from studies in patients with contiguous gene deletions in the Xp22.3 region. These patients, in addition to KS, also displayed X-linked ichthyosis and chondrodysplasia punctata, linked to disruption of adjacent genes (<em>STS</em> and <em>ARSE</em>, respectively). While such large deletions are rare, overall, ANOS1 genomic <span class=\"nowrap\">changes/mutations</span> together account for 10 to 14 percent of familial KS cases but are seen less often in sporadic cases. An X-linked mode of inheritance within the family is a clue to this gene as the cause of KS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Obligate female carriers of <em>ANOS1</em> mutations typically have no discernible abnormal phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, the clinical phenotypes of KS subjects with <em>ANOS1 </em>mutations lie in the more severe end of the phenotypic spectrum of IHH, demonstrating a high incidence of microphallus, cryptorchidism, and small testes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. This subset of KS patients also has the poorest response to therapy in terms of spermatogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], largely relating to the duration and severity of their cryptorchidism. Generally, <em>ANOS1</em> mutations appear to be the most penetrant of the genes causing congenital GnRH deficiency. KS subjects with <em>ANOS1</em> mutations also display several nonreproductive features, including unilateral renal agenesis and synkinesia (or mirror movements) that signal renal and cerebellar abnormalities in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In keeping with these distinguishing clinical signatures, anosmin-1 is expressed in nonreproductive tissues, such as mesonephric tubules, ureteric bud, digestive tract, large blood vessels, and inner ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>SOX10</em></strong><strong> (SRY-box 10 gene), autosomal dominant KS with variable penetrance </strong>&ndash; The <em>SOX10</em> gene (SRY-box 10) had previously been associated with Waardenburg syndrome (WS), a heterogeneous human &quot;neurocristopathy&quot; (ie, disorders in cells from the neural crest origin) characterized by variable sensorineural deafness, abnormal skin and iris pigmentation, and Hirschsprung's disease. An involvement of <em>SOX10 </em>in KS was hypothesized due to the fact that some WS patients also have olfactory bulb agenesis. In one report, 30 percent of patients with KS and hearing loss had mutations in <em>SOX10 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Semaphorin 3A, a secreted guidance cue of the class 3 semaphorin family, is critical for GnRH neuronal migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Another group reported similar <em>KISS1R </em>mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">How these mutations might lead to IHH was assessed in a <em>GPR54</em>-deficient mouse model that resulted in a phenotype similar to that in humans (ie, IHH that was responsive to exogenous GnRH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The mice had normal hypothalamic GnRH content, thus demonstrating that GnRH neurons are present in the hypothalamus and can synthesize their peptide but <em>KISS1R</em> is necessary for processing or secretion of GnRH. These observations suggest that the <em>KISS1R</em> gene may be an important gatekeeper gene for puberty.

As many of the genes causing IHH have pleotropic physiologic functions, genetic testing can aid assessment of both reproductive and nonreproductive clinical features. In addition, ascertaining the specific inheritance modes can aid genetic screening within the family to predict future recurrence risk in siblings, family members or offspring of IHH patients. However, genetic testing in IHH is challenging, given the genetic and allelic heterogeneity, as well as complex oligogenic inheritance patterns. However, in the presence of either clear Mendelian inheritance patterns or specific phenotypic cues, targeted genetic testing or multigene panel testing may be performed. However, if such testing is done, variant interpretation and genetic counseling should be performed in conjunction with a clinical genetics service. Alternatively, several research units have special interests in the genetics of IHH, and clinicians can consider referring these patients to such specialized centers.

The dose is then gradually increased over several years. Initial therapy should consist of unopposed estrogen alone to maximize breast growth, achieve appropriate skeletal maturation, and to induce uterine and endometrial proliferation. A progestin eventually needs to be added to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, but adding it prematurely or administering combinations of estrogens and progestins (eg, birth control pills) before completion of breast development should be avoided because it is likely to reduce ultimate breast size.

A distinct feature of pulsatile GnRH therapy is that given the physiologic stimulation, the resulting serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations remain within the normal range and the chances of multifollicular development and ovarian hyperstimulation are therefore low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

The importance of pulsatile secretion is reviewed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gonadotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a>). GnRH is administered subcutaneously at two-hour intervals via a portable mini-pump that infuses GnRH over 60 seconds. This frequency is set to replicate that of endogenous GnRH-induced LH pulses in normal men (every 120 minutes). Treatment is begun at a dose of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/kg</span> per bolus and adjusted upward on the basis of the serum testosterone concentration. When normal values have been achieved, the dose is held constant, and measurement of testicular size and seminal fluid analysis are performed at serial intervals (every two to three months).</p><p>Maturation of spermatogenesis can take one to two years during normal puberty. Thus, both gonadotropin therapy as well as pulsatile GnRH therapy must be given for an equivalent period depending upon the pretreatment testicular volume. Men with infantile testes (eg, 1 to 3 mL) or a past history of cryptorchidism require the longest durations of therapy, whereas those with larger testicular size respond sooner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/5,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,83</a>].</p><p>Since FSH induces Sertoli cell and germ cell proliferation in immature testes and androgen production from the Leydig cells terminates proliferation and promotes differentiation, a randomized, open-label trial tested the hypothesis that FSH priming for four months prior to LH and FSH (using pulsatile GnRH) could enhance fertility outcomes in IHH men with infantile testes and no cryptorchidism. FSH priming nearly doubled the testicular volume with histologic evidence of Sertoli cell proliferation, and all men receiving FSH priming developed sperm in their ejaculate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

Pulsatile GnRH results in more testicular growth than do gonadotropins. However, they do not seem to have any difference in the outcome of induction of spermatogenesis, which occurs in approximately 75 to 90 percent of men with either approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/85-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-88</a>].

There are sparse comparative data on pregnancy rates between the two therapies as the number of patients who have been studied after pulsatile GnRH therapy is quite limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/23,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,89</a>].</p><p>It is important to recognize that conception can occur in IHH patients even with relatively low sperm counts since sperm function is usually normal in those without a history of cryptorchidism. Previous treatment with gonadotropins may reduce the period of subsequent gonadotropin treatment required for initiation of spermatogenesis. If natural conception does not occur despite spermatogenesis, assisted reproductive techniques (intracytoplasmic sperm insemination or in vitro fertilization) should be considered.</p><p>Therapeutic failure with gonadotropin therapy can occur in IHH men with severe pubertal delay with prepubertal testicular volume at baseline. Therapeutic failure with pulsatile GnRH therapy can occur in IHH men with unresponsive pituitaries to GnRH (eg, due to hemochromatosis) or secondary failures coincident with the development of antibodies to GnRH. The latter is a rare occurrence and generally occurs in the setting of intermittent or discontinuous therapy. Additionally, rare instances of failure to respond to GnRH therapy have uncovered additional defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94286031\"><span class=\"h2\">Reversal of IHH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IHH was previously thought to be a permanent disorder requiring lifelong therapy. However, reversal of the disorder has been reported in approximately 10 percent of male patients after discontinuation of hormonal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. This was illustrated in a report of 15 male patients (mean age 21 years), 10 of whom were identified retrospectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The other five patients were identified prospectively among 50 men with IHH (10 percent) at a mean of 6&plusmn;3 weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Sustained reversal of IHH was defined as the presence of normal adult testosterone levels after hormonal therapy was discontinued. The rate of reversal was similar for men who had absent or partial puberty at initial presentation. Mean testicular volume and serum total testosterone concentrations increased into the normal adult male range, and both pulsatile LH secretion and spermatogenesis were documented.</p><p>Paradoxical increase in testicular volume in a male IHH patient while on testosterone therapy should alert the clinician that potential endogenous GnRH secretory activity has occurred. Normalization of serum testosterone levels off therapy is diagnostic of reversal of IHH. The precise mechanisms behind this reversal process remain unknown and can occur even in those with severe hypogonadotropism including those with anosmic form of IHH, ie, Kallmann syndrome (KS). In a study, nearly 45 percent of reversal subjects had demonstrable IHH-related gene mutations, but a significant number of reversal subjects harbored mutations that disrupt neurokinin B signalling (<em><span class=\"nowrap\">TAC3/TACR3</em>),</span> suggesting that the neurokinin B pathway, although critical for puberty, may be dispensable later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, reversal of hypogonadism in other genetic forms of IHH has also been reported, suggesting that this is not unique to a single genetic group of patients.</p><p>Longitudinal review of subjects undergoing reversal has also demonstrated a fragility of this reversal phenomenon as some patients manifest relapse into an IHH state, requiring reintroduction of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism/abstract/80,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,92</a>].

For men who have achieved normal testicular volume while being treated with testosterone alone (which is often the initial treatment when fertility is not yet desired), we recommend that testosterone treatment be discontinued and serum testosterone be determined after two to three months. The rationale is that testosterone treatment will not directly increase testicular size, and therefore, the increase is probably the result of endogenous gonadotropin secretion. For men who have achieved adult reproductive parameters (testicular volume, serum testosterone concentrations, and sperm in the ejaculate) during treatment with gonadotropins or GnRH, hormonal therapy could be discontinued for two to three months if the patient wishes to evaluate for possible reversibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111576533\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency (IGD), or idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), refers to the functional absence of GnRH secretion from hypothalamic hypophysiotropic neurons or a defect in its action at the level of the gonadotrope in the case of mutations in the GnRH receptor.
