NSR is the rhythm that originates from the sinus node. The rate in NSR is generally regular but will vary depending on autonomic inputs into the sinus node. There can be an irregularity in the sinus rate and, when this occurs, it is termed &quot;sinus arrhythmia&quot;. A sinus rhythm faster than the normal range is called a sinus tachycardia, while a slower rate is called a sinus bradycardia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinus-tachycardia-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinus tachycardia: Evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinus-bradycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinus bradycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The sinoatrial (SA) node, due to its small mass, does not have a visible manifestation on the ECG. The behavior of the SA node, therefore, must be inferred from the atrial response. The upper right atrium is depolarized first, followed by the simultaneous depolarization of the remainder of the right and some of the left atrium, and finally by depolarization of the left atrial appendage. The blood supply and anatomy of the SA node along with the ECG characteristics of NSR and sinus arrhythmia will be discussed here. Abnormalities of SA nodal function are considered elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinoatrial-nodal-pause-arrest-and-exit-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinoatrial nodal pause, arrest, and exit block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL SINUS HEART RATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal heart rate has been considered to be between 60 and 100 beats per minute, although there is some disagreement with regard to the normal rate in adults. The range (defined by 1st and 99<sup>th</sup> percentiles) is between 43 and 102 beats per minute in men and between 47 and 103 beats per minute in women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77746\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77746 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. There is also important variability in age in young children. The normal heart rate is 110 to 150 beats per minute in infants, with gradual slowing over the first six years of life.</p><p>A variety of pharmacologic agents and physiologic conditions can result in changes to the normal sinus heart rate. These conditions are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinus-tachycardia-evaluation-and-management#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinus tachycardia: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinus-bradycardia#H1042741709\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinus bradycardia&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>The normal heart rate increases with exertion and decreases following the cessation of activity. The rate at which the heart rate returns to baseline following exercise can have prognostic importance, a concept which is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing to determine prognosis of coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Heart rate response to exercise'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-to-determine-prognosis-of-coronary-heart-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing to determine prognosis of coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Heart rate recovery after exercise'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7013837\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sinoatrial (SA) node is located high (superiorly) in the right atrium at the junction of the crista terminalis (a thick band of atrial muscle at the border of the atrial appendage) and the superior vena cava. The SA node is located beneath the epicardial surface of the crista terminalis; there is a layer of atrial muscle between the SA node and the endocardium so that it does not occupy the entire thickness of the atrial myocardium. Human histologic studies have demonstrated that the SA node has a crescent-like shape with an average length of 13.5 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>A characteristic feature of the SA node is extensive connective tissue, mainly collagen and fibroblasts, enmeshed with specialized cells capable of pacemaking activity. All of these cells within the SA node are capable of pacemaker activity, and depending on autonomic activation, the origin of the electrical activity can shift from one area of the SA node to another (superiorly during predominant sympathetic activation and more inferiorly during predominant parasympathetic activation). Studies have described a collection of cells, known as the paranodal cells, which are electrically and histologically distinct from the SA node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These cells are thought to facilitate electrical conduction from the SA node to the rest of the atrium and have been hypothesized as a source of some of the more common atrial tachycardias originating from the cristae terminalis area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-atrial-tachycardia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal atrial tachycardia&quot;, section on 'Sites of origin'</a>.)</p><p>While it may appear that the electrical signals from the SA node to the atrial periphery can exit randomly, there appear to be preferential pathways of conduction from the sinus pacemaker cells to the atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Whether these are functional or anatomical exit paths remains unclear. The conduction velocity within the SA node is very slow compared with non-nodal atrial tissue. This is a result of poor electrical coupling arising from the relative paucity of gap junctions in the center of the node compared with the periphery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>SA nodal dysfunction may result from abnormalities in impulse generation or in conduction across the paranodal cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinoatrial-nodal-pause-arrest-and-exit-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sinoatrial nodal pause, arrest, and exit block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7014272\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD SUPPLY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, studies had suggested that over 90 percent of hearts have only one arterial branch to the SA node, and common wisdom was that the right coronary artery supplied the SA node in about 55 percent of hearts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. More recent data, however, suggest that the SA nodal artery may take one of six different routes, and two or more branches to the node may be present in about 54 percent of hearts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This suggests that collateral blood supplies are common and perhaps explains the rarity of infarction involving the SA node. However, sinus node injury may be seen as a complication of left atrial ablation depending on the course of the SA nodal artery relative to the atrial tissue targeted with ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7014381\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF NSR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7014457\"><span class=\"h2\">P wave duration and amplitude</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The P wave is normally less than 120 milliseconds in duration and under 0.15 or 0.20 mV (or in some texts 0.25 mV) in height in standard lead II, with the permissible maximum varying according to the lead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The terminal component in lead V1 should be less than 0.04 seconds long and 0.1 mV (1 mm) deep. Atrial repolarization usually is not seen on the electrocardiogram.

The left atrium is a leftward and posterior structure, so LAE increases the <strong>leftward</strong> and <strong>posterior</strong> vectors and, when there is an associated intraatrial conduction delay, prolongs the duration of the P wave. The ECG criteria for LAE reflect these events (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64928\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64928 \">waveform 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The P wave is wide in lead II (&ge;120 milliseconds) and is usually notched in I and II.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The P <span class=\"nowrap\">duration/PR</span> segment is greater than 1.6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The terminal P wave in lead V1 is deep and delayed with the negative deflection being greater than 40 milliseconds in duration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &ge;0.1 mV (1 mm) in height. The Morris index of the P terminal force is the product of the amplitude and duration of the terminal portion of the P wave in V1, and a value of 40 mV-ms suggests left atrial enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A negative P duration in V1 divided by the PR interval that is &ge;1.0 has also been suggested as a criterion for LAE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The axis of the late component is often to the left (40&ordm; or less).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Right atrial enlargement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to LAE, the ECG pattern of right atrial enlargement (RAE) lacks precision as RAE may arise from dilatation, hypertrophy, or a conduction defect. The right atrium is a rightward and anterior structure, so RAE results in an increase in the <strong>anterior</strong>, <strong>rightward</strong>, and <strong>inferior</strong> forces of early atrial activation (which, as noted above, begins in the right atrium). This leads to the following pattern of right atrial enlargement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64928\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64928 \">waveform 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prominent P waves (0.2 mV [2 mm] or greater in height) in the limb leads, particularly II and aVF, and in an anterior lead such as V1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial P force in lead V1 is often &ge;60 mV-msec.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The P wave duration is 110 milliseconds or less with an axis of 65&ordm; or more.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Biatrial enlargement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biatrial enlargement has characteristics of both right atrial and left atrial abnormalities. The right atrial abnormality increases the P wave amplitude in the appropriate leads, and the left atrial abnormality will broaden and notch the P waves and may increase the terminal force of the P waves in V1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64928\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64928 \">waveform 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">The PR interval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal PR interval is 120 to 200 milliseconds. The PR interval tends to shorten as the heart rate increases due to rate-related shortening of action potentials and perhaps the effects of the autonomic nervous system on the AV node. Although there is some difference between small and large adults, the maximum PR interval is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>170 milliseconds for sinus rates over 130 beats per minute</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>180 to 190 milliseconds for rates between 100 and 130 beats per minute</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>200 milliseconds for rates between 70 and 100 beats per minute</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>210 milliseconds for rates slower than 70 beats per minute</p><p/><p>Children have shorter upper limits of normal for PR intervals; 0.14 seconds is a useful figure to remember under age 14, although the PR interval may be somewhat longer at slow rates and somewhat shorter at fast rates.</p><p>The PR interval is independent of whether or not sinus rhythm is present. Normal sinus rhythm can be present even in the presence of complete heart block. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-degree-complete-atrioventricular-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third degree (complete) atrioventricular block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SINUS ARRHYTHMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sinus arrhythmia is defined as an irregularity in the rate of normal sinus rhythm. Sinus arrhythmia is considered present when there is a variation in the P-P interval by 0.12 seconds (120 msec) or more but atrial activation appears to be occurring via the sinus node. Occasionally, there can be irregularity in the sinus rate, but the P-wave morphology varies and this can be consistent with &quot;wandering atrial pacemaker&quot; discussed elsewhere.</p><p>There are three types of sinus arrhythmia: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory, or phasic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonrespiratory, or nonphasic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonrespiratory, ventriculophasic sinus arrhythmia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory sinus arrhythmia is a common, benign, and usually normal phenomenon that is related mechanistically to alternations in autonomic input directly and due to changes in cardiac filling during respiration. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia has been associated with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Some studies suggest that respiratory sinus arrhythmia is the result of these conditions, while others have documented a reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia among individuals prior to the onset of disease. While severe respiratory sinus arrhythmia has been associated with several systemic conditions, for the most part, respiratory sinus arrhythmia is benign and does not require additional cardiac evaluation. </p><p>During the respiratory cycle, inspiration reflexively inhibits vagal tone, thereby increasing the sinus rate, while with expiration vagal tone rises to its previous state, and the rate declines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65949\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef65949 \">waveform 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This type of sinus arrhythmia disappears with breath holding. However, stimulation of the carotid baroreceptors by neck suction during breath holding will restore sinus arrhythmia, suggesting that the autonomic changes responsible for sinus arrhythmia can also be due to baroreflex stimulation. Baroreceptor stimulation may result from cyclic alterations in arterial blood pressure induced by the respiratory effect on venous return [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Respiratory sinus arrhythmia also appears to be less prominent as people age. As an example, in a study of 24 healthy volunteers without evidence of cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease, respiratory sinus arrhythmia in older subjects (age 59 to 71 years, n = 15) was less than 20 percent of that in younger subjects (&lt;31 years of age, n = 9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A possible reason for this observation is an age-related decrease in carotid distensibility and baroreflex sensitivity, without a change in resting vagal tone.</p><p>Other factors may contribute to respiratory sinus arrhythmia. These include sympathetic mechanisms, elevations in arterial PCO2 that increase the magnitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, probably via a direct effect on the medulla, and drugs that increase vagal tone, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> or digitalis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. In contrast, hypocapnia caused by voluntary hyperventilation reduces sinus arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Sinus arrhythmia is also reduced in diabetes mellitus, perhaps reflecting autonomic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In some subjects, autonomic changes during respiration cause the activation within the SA node to change, leading to subtle changes in P wave morphology and the PR interval. If depression of the SA node is sufficient, ectopic atrial pacemakers may occur; in this setting, prominently different P waves may be seen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-atrial-and-atrioventricular-nodal-supraventricular-arrhythmias#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Atrial and atrioventricular nodal (supraventricular) arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Wandering atrial pacemaker'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multifocal-atrial-tachycardia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multifocal atrial tachycardia&quot;, section on 'Definition, pathogenesis, and prevalence'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonrespiratory type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonrespiratory sinus arrhythmia differs in that the acceleration and deceleration of the SA node is not related to the respiratory cycle. This form of sinus arrhythmia can occur in the normal heart, in the diseased heart, or after digitalis intoxication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventriculophasic type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A ventriculophasic sinus arrhythmia occurs most often in patients with third degree AV block, but it can also be seen after a compensatory pause induced by a premature ventricular contraction. This arrhythmia is characterized by intermittent differences in the PP intervals based upon their relationship to the QRS complex. The two P waves surrounding a QRS complex have a shortened interval (ie, they occur at a faster rate) when compared with two P waves that occur sequentially without an intervening QRS complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54964\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54964 \">waveform 4</a>). The cause is not fully understood but seems to be related to increased filling during the long cycle; this is followed by a forceful systole and increased stroke volume which, in turn, trigger a baroreceptor response. In orthotopic cardiac transplantation, ventriculophasic arrhythmia is absent despite intact vagal innervation to the atrial remnant, which suggests that the lack of pulsatile blood flow in the SA node may contribute to the absence of the ventriculophasic arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is based on the evaluation of ventriculophasic arrhythmia following a premature ventricular beat and describes the short-term fluctuation in sinus cycle length that follows such a beat. This is discussed in greater detail separately.

This arrhythmia is characterized by intermittent differences in the PP intervals based upon their relationship to the QRS complex. The two P waves surrounding a QRS complex have a shortened interval (ie, they occur at a faster rate) when compared with two P waves that occur sequentially without an intervening QRS complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54964\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54964 \">waveform 4</a>).
