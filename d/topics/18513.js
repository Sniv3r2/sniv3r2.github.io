Obstruction can occur at valvar, subvalvar, and supravalvar levels.</p><p>The most common form of LVOT obstruction in children is valvar aortic stenosis (AS), accounting for as many as 71 to 86 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. More than three-quarters of affected patients are male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Valvar AS will be reviewed here. Subvalvar and supravalvar AS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subvalvar-aortic-stenosis-subaortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subvalvar aortic stenosis (subaortic stenosis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supravalvar-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supravalvar aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among children with valvar AS, the most common cause is a bicommissural or bicuspid aortic valve, that is, only two leaflets are present rather than the normal three. Bicommissural aortic valve is associated with both congenital and acquired aortic stenosis. It is also the most common cause of acquired AS in adults. As an example, a review of 932 adults who underwent operative excision of an aortic stenotic valve reported that two-thirds of the patients had a bicommissural aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The severity of AS progressed with age, with the majority of patients requiring surgical intervention after 50 years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based upon large retrospective autopsy studies, bicommissural aortic valve had been estimated to occur in 1 to 2 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. This is likely to be an overestimation as demonstrated by two echocardiographic screening studies, which reported a lower prevalence of 0.5 percent in both neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and school-aged children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In each of these studies, bicommissural aortic valves were more common among males than females (0.7 versus 0.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Familial clustering has also been observed, as approximately 35 percent of patients with a bicommissural aortic valve have at least one additional family member with a bicommissural aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Patients with congenital AS are slightly more likely to have offspring with congenital heart disease (CHD). This was illustrated in a report from the Second Natural History Study of Congenital Heart Defects (NHS-2) in which CHD occurred in 3 offspring of 251 (1.2 percent) males with AS and 1 of 72 females (1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; these values are somewhat higher than the 0.5 to 0.8 percent incidence of CHD in live births in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>].</p><p>Associated cardiovascular anomalies have been noted in as many as 20 percent of children with congenital AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among patients with a bicommissural aortic valve, coexisting coarctation of the aorta is seen in approximately 6 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; on the other hand, as many as 30 to 40 percent of patients with coarctation have a bicommissural aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Dilated ascending aorta is commonly associated with bicommissural aortic valve. Less common concomitant congenital anomalies include ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, bicommissural pulmonic valve, and congenital mitral regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Less common forms of congenital AS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unicommissural or unicuspid aortic valves, in which two of the three commissures are fused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic annular hypoplasia, which may be an isolated abnormality or may be seen in association with leaflet abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p>These rarer forms of congenital AS are often associated with severe obstruction to left ventricular outflow and heart failure in infancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal aortic valve has three commissures, which results in three leaflets of approximately equal size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The free margins of the leaflets have a semilunar shape. Normal leaflets are smooth and pliable. In older patients, a fibrous nodule may be located at the center of their free margins.</p><p>Mild AS from a bicommissural aortic valve commonly progresses as the patient ages, although the rate is variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the majority of patients with bicommissural aortic valves, the size of the valve leaflets is unequal, which is thought to result from the fusion or absence of one of the three valve commissures; a false commissure or raphe is frequently present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. With absence of the right-left (intercoronary) commissure, the most common form, the leaflets are oriented anterior and posterior, the raphe is usually in the anterior leaflet, and both coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses above the anterior leaflet. In a series of 1135 patients, this orientation was found in 70 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Less commonly, there is absence of the right-noncoronary commissure, and the leaflets are oriented to the right and left; the raphe is usually in the right leaflet, and the coronary arteries arise from the aortic sinuses above each leaflet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108115\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef108115 \">movie 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Absence or fusion of the left-noncoronary commissure is exceedingly rare. The free margins of a bicommissural valve are relatively straight rather than semilunar. This configuration limits their mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Bicommissural valve morphology has clinical and prognostic importance, as illustrated in the review of 1135 patients cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients with fusion of the right-noncoronary commissure had a higher incidence of valvar dysfunction: moderate or greater AS, and moderate or greater aortic regurgitation (AR). In contrast, patients with the more common absence of the right-left commissure had lesser degrees of aortic valve dysfunction, but an increased incidence of coarctation of the aorta; 89 percent of patients with coarctation and a bicommissural aortic valve had the absent right-left commissure morphology.</p><p>In a subsequent nested cohort longitudinal study of 310 patients selected from the above study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], patients with the right-noncoronary commissural absence compared with those with right-left commissural absence were more likely to require intervention because of more rapid progression of AS and AR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A unicommissural or unicuspid aortic valve results from the absence of two of the three commissures. Most commonly, the patent commissure is the left-noncoronary commissure, which results in a valve with an eccentric, teardrop-shaped opening that may extend leftward and posteriorly to the annulus. The valve is thus described as having a single &quot;cusp.&quot; Absence of all three commissures results in aortic atresia and usually in the hypoplastic left heart syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases of valvar AS, systemic blood pressure and cardiac output remain normal because left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure and total cardiac work are elevated. Despite the increase in total cardiac work, wall stress remains normal or even reduced, presumably because of the compensatory increase in LV wall thickness. In a study of LV mechanics, the ejection fraction (0.88 versus 0.64) and mean velocity of fiber shortening (1.8 versus 1.22 <span class=\"nowrap\">circ/s)</span> were higher in children with AS than in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>An important physiologic derangement in valvar AS is the relative reduction in coronary blood supply to a hypertrophied, hypertensive LV with increased myocardial oxygen demand. This may lead to subendocardial ischemia and infarction. The imbalance between supply and demand is due to a decrease in coronary perfusion pressure and a shortened diastolic filling period (due to prolonged systolic ejection across the stenotic orifice). This imbalance is exaggerated by exercise, which further shortens the diastolic filling period, decreases coronary perfusion, increases the gradient across the stenotic aortic valve, and results in both increased myocardial oxygen demand and decreased myocardial oxygen delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with congenital valvar AS, even to moderate degrees, are relatively asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patients with bicommissural valves and no stenosis still require long-term follow-up, because progressive stenosis develops in approximately 75 percent of adults. Thickening and focal calcification of the bicommissural valve can be detected pathologically and on echocardiography as early as the second decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>More severe disease in childhood is not uncommon, as approximately 10 percent of patients develop heart failure during the first year after birth. Of these, approximately two-thirds become symptomatic by two months of age, and most present before six months. Infants with critical AS, the most severe form, present with signs of severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock in the neonatal period or shortly thereafter, following closure of the ductus arteriosus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Critical AS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Critical AS is often well tolerated in utero because left ventricular (LV) output is decreased and the right ventricle (RV) supports a greater share of the fetal cardiac output via the ductus arteriosus. However, there are reports of in utero cardiac dysfunction, hydrops fetalis, and endocardial fibroelastosis due to critical AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In particular, the rare combination of severe fetal AS and mitral regurgitation results in left heart dilation and compression of the RV causing poor cardiac output and hydrops fetalis, and a poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In addition, severely restricted forward flow from critical AS may lead to hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) with small left-sided heart structures in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Fetal echocardiography may be helpful in predicting which fetuses with AS will develop HLHS. Identification of these fetuses becomes increasingly important with the possible development of in utero intervention to prevent the progression of AS to HLHS. In one study from a tertiary center, fetuses at midgestation (16 to 30 weeks gestation) who were more likely to develop HLHS had echographic findings of reversed blood flow in the transverse aortic arch, left-to-right blood flow across the foramen ovale, monophasic mitral valve inflow, and moderate to severe LV dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, the ability to detect these changes is dependent on operator expertise, and in other clinical settings the ability to detect prenatal heart disease is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H330268351\" class=\"local\">'Fetal intervention'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome-management-and-outcome#H2135515856\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Fetal intervention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal cardiac abnormalities: Screening, evaluation, and pregnancy management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following delivery, the ductus arteriosus closes, pulmonary vascular resistance falls, and venous return to the left atrium increases. If the LV cannot fill or eject a sufficient volume of blood, cardiac output cannot be maintained, leading to signs and symptoms of heart failure or even cardiogenic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This condition is fatal without intervention.</p><p>Infants with critical AS may present at birth with poor peripheral perfusion and cyanosis. Physical examination reveals a hyperactive precordium and poor pulses. A cardiac murmur is frequently not heard because of the poor cardiac output. Although a gallop rhythm may be appreciated, an ejection click is almost never present. Distal pulses are often poor or inappreciable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Infantile AS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with severe, but not critical, AS present in infancy with heart failure.

The long-term outcome of this disorder was evaluated in the Second Natural History Study of Congenital Heart Defects (NHS-2) study, which included 371 patients (mostly children) with AS who underwent cardiac catheterization from 1958 to 1969; 92 percent were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The risk was greater in patients treated surgically (0.41 versus 0.16 percent per year in those with less severe disease who were treated medically). The applicability of these findings to current practice is uncertain since the data were obtained before widespread use of antimicrobial prophylaxis.

There were no differences in five-year survival (72 percent) or freedom from reintervention (48 percent) between the two groups.

Five-year freedom from reintervention was similar in the BAV and surgical valvotomy groups (77 and 71 percent, respectively), as was mean reintervention-free survival (12 years in the BAV group and 14.5 years in the surgical valvotomy group).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A third study concluded that surgical intervention was superior to BAV:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In this retrospective study of 123 neonates and infants with AS treated at a single center from 1977 to 2009, the overall 20-year survival rate was 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Multivariate analysis showed the risk of reintervention was associated with BAV or treatment as a neonate. In this cohort, freedom from reintervention at five years was lower in patients treated with BAV compared with those who underwent surgical repair (27 versus 65 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">However, the reintervention rate following BAV in this study is much higher than that reported from other tertiary centers, including (as discussed above) our own [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This may be due to bias in their approach as noted by the accompanying editorial that observed that BAV had been &quot;abandoned&quot; in their institution since 2006, and therefore the BAV outcome may have been improved due to subsequent technological improvements in catheterization and BAV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Furthermore, the selection criteria for BAV versus surgery were not reported, the balloon:annulus ratio at BAV was higher than that recommended at most centers performing BAV, and the criteria for reintervention following BAV were not supplied. The editorial does comment that surgical intervention may be preferred in some settings based on the morphology of the aortic valve, such as in patients who have resectable valvar nodules or thickened valves that would benefit from surgical thinning.

AVR also may be performed in children with congenital valvar AS who develop severe AR following BAV. Mechanical prosthetic valves are preferred because of better long-term durability even though they require systemic anticoagulation. Bioprosthetic valves reduce the need for anticoagulation, but have a high failure rate in children and young adults, approaching 20 percent within a follow-up period of three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

A younger age at initial AVR was a risk factor for both death and repeat valve replacement. A younger age was associated with the presence of other cardiac anomalies, which increased the risk of death, and with outgrowth of the original prosthetic valve requiring subsequent replacement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Echocardiographic surveillance is typically performed every 6 to 12 months for children with mechanical valves, and every 3 to 6 months for children with bioprosthetic valves due to the differences in valve durability; however, there are no published guidelines.

With this procedure, the pulmonary valve is transplanted to the aortic position, and a homograft conduit is implanted from the RV to the pulmonary artery. Use of this technique has been limited by the high rates of failure of the pulmonary autograft and deterioration of the right heart homografts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In two meta-analyses of published studies on the Ross procedure in children, early mortality was 4.2 percent, late mortality was 0.6 percent, and the rate of autograft deterioration was 1.4 to 1.9 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. In one analysis, a higher rate of autograft deterioration was observed in patients with predominantly aortic regurgitation, presumably due to progressive annular and aortic root dilation, which has led some to avoid the Ross procedure in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Newer modifications to prevent progressive dilation of the autograft aortic root include placement of a bioabsorbable ring at the sino-tubular junction, which was reported to reduce the risk of subsequent AR in a case series of 19 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Indications for intervention'</a> above.)</p><p>There is evidence that exercise restriction following successful balloon aortic valvotomy (BAV) may not be necessary. This was illustrated by a retrospective review of 528 patients who underwent BAV at our tertiary center from 1984 to 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvar-aortic-stenosis-in-children/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. At a median follow-up of 12 years, there were 63 deaths including sudden unexpected death (SUD) in six patients, five of which occurred at &le;18 months of age. In patients &gt;4 years of age, exercise restriction was prescribed in 43 percent and included the one patient with SUD. As a result, we conclude that SUD is extremely rare after BAV, and there is no beneficial effect for exercise restriction in these patients.</p><p>Physical activity and exercise in children with CHD are discussed in greater detail separately.

Patients with valvar AS are at increased risk of endocarditis; however, as there is considerable uncertainty regarding the efficacy of the practice of subacute bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis, guidelines emphasize prophylaxis only for those patients at greatest risk from the sequelae of endocarditis, a group into which most patients with native AS do not fall.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In adults with AS, bicuspid aortic valve is the most common valve anomaly.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical findings vary depending on the severity of the stenotic lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most children with valvar AS, even those with moderate disease, are relatively asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Critical AS in the neonate results in severe restricted outward flow and is fatal in patients without intervention. Neonates with critical AS will present with poor peripheral perfusion and cyanosis as the ductus arteriosus closes. Physical findings include a hyperactive precordium and poor peripheral pulses. A cardiac murmur is frequently not heard because of poor cardiac output. A gallop rhythm may also be present. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Critical AS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants with severe, but not critical, AS may present with heart failure, which is characterized by poor feeding, growth failure and tachypnea, and physical findings including hyperactive precordium, ejection murmur, and often hepatomegaly and peripheral edema. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Infantile AS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Older children with AS are rarely symptomatic and are generally identified by the presence of the characteristic harsh ejection murmur, which may be accompanied by an ejection click. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Older children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with congenital valvar AS often have progressive obstruction and are at increased risk for infectious endocarditis and sudden death. The risk of mortality is greater in patients with more severe disease who have significant obstruction and aortic regurgitation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of valvar AS may be made on physical findings and generally confirmed by echocardiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59607\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef59607 \">movie 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108115\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef108115 \">movie 1</a>). Cardiac catheterization is performed if the <span class=\"nowrap\">severity/diagnosis</span> remains uncertain, if there are associated defects that cannot be completely evaluated noninvasively, or if balloon aortic valvuloplasty is anticipated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment is indicated for patients who present with severe obstruction, which is especially urgent in the critically ill neonate and infant with heart failure. In other patients, the decision to treat is based on the peak-to-peak systolic gradient obtained during cardiac catheterization (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Indications for intervention'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a peak-to-peak systolic gradient &gt;50 mmHg should be treated, as they are at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death due to progressive obstruction from their lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with a peak-to-peak systolic gradient &lt;25 mmHg can be followed medically on a regular basis as they have mild disease and are at low risk for mortality and morbidity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Data are less conclusive of patients with a peak-to-peak systolic gradient between 25 and 50 mmHg, as they are at intermediate risk for poor outcome. In our practice, we monitor their clinical status closely and intervene if there is a worsening of the gradient or development of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive therapy consists of reducing the degree of valvar stenosis. In our center, the treatment of choice is balloon valvuloplasty, regardless of the age and size of the patient, which has largely replaced surgical valvotomy. Aortic valve replacement is usually reserved for adults with congenital AS in whom balloon dilation is generally ineffective.
