(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation#H111256161\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Secondary MR'</a>.) </p><p>The prevalence of degenerative mitral valve disease with MVP was approximately 2 to 3 percent in two North American studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The majority of patients with MVP have MR (approximately 70 percent in one cross-sectional population-based study), but most patients with MVP and MR have mild or trace MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Severe MR is uncommon, identified in 4 percent of patients with MVP. </p><p>A high prevalence of MR is seen following myocardial infarction (MI). The reported prevalence of MR detected at cardiac catheterization in the setting of acute MI has ranged from 9 to 13 percent; the MR was moderate to severe in 3 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Higher rates of MR are seen with transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation performed days to weeks after MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>] as illustrated by a community-based study of 773 patients who were evaluated within 30 days after an ST elevation or non-ST elevation MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. MR was present in 50 percent (mild in 38 percent and moderate or severe in 12 percent). Similar findings were noted in a study of 300 patients who underwent transthoracic echocardiography within one week of a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. MR was detected with color flow Doppler echocardiography in 42 percent; the MR was mild in 63 percent, mild to moderate in 20 percent, and moderate or severe in 17 percent. MR at the time of or during the first month after MI is seen with increased frequency in older patients and in women, and it is associated with higher Killip class and lower left ventricular ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Some degree of secondary MR is almost always present in patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, regardless of etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. In a study of 470 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, 62 percent had absent or mild MR and 38 percent of patients has moderate to severe secondary MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Secondary MR is also a common problem in patients with end-stage renal disease on maintenance dialysis. In this setting, volume expansion rather than intrinsic cardiac disease is primarily responsible for the cardiac enlargement. One study of 21 hemodialysis patients with both MR and tricuspid regurgitation assessed whether valvular regurgitation disappeared with aggressive ultrafiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. After intensified sessions resulting in a decrease in body weight of approximately 5.4 kg, MR and tricuspid regurgitation was no longer present in 62 percent and 66 percent of patients, respectively. Among those with persistent abnormalities, the degree of regurgitation was much less severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10779617\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nature and severity of the symptoms associated with chronic MR are related to the severity of MR, its rate of progression, the pulmonary artery pressure, arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation), and associated cardiac disease. Because of the importance of identifying the transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic MR in determining the timing of mitral valve surgery, a careful history is important to establish a good estimate of baseline exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Since symptoms occur late in patients with primary MR, serial monitoring of asymptomatic patients is required. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Serial monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with isolated mild to moderate primary MR are asymptomatic, since there is little volume overload of the ventricle and cardiac hemodynamics, and forward cardiac output remains normal. Most remain asymptomatic until there is left ventricular (LV) cavity enlargement with systolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, or the onset of atrial fibrillation. The most common symptoms are exertional dyspnea and fatigue due to the combination of a decreased forward (ie, effective) cardiac output, an increase in left atrial pressure due to backflow across the mitral valve, and pulmonary artery hypertension. Another common clinical presentation is paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Patients with severe MR and LV enlargement eventually progress to symptomatic heart failure with pulmonary congestion and edema. At this stage of LV dilatation, the myocardial dysfunction is often irreversible due to the long-standing MR. In some cases, irreversible LV systolic dysfunction occurs in the absence of symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with chronic secondary MR (ischemic or non-ischemic) have mild MR, and the clinical presentation (including symptoms and signs of heart failure) generally reflects the state of ventricular dysfunction more than the state of the mitral valve. However, patients with only mild secondary MR at rest may develop severe MR with exercise, leading to acute pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Among patients with chronic secondary MR who develop symptoms, the most common complaints reflect decreased forward or effective cardiac output and include weakness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance. Patients with more severe disease or with exercise-induced worsening of MR may present with symptomatic heart failure or pulmonary edema. However, it may be difficult to separate symptoms due to primary LV systolic dysfunction from those due to the added burden of secondary MR. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Other symptoms such as thromboembolism, hemoptysis, and right-sided heart failure do occur, but are less common than with mitral stenosis. However, there is an increased risk of infective endocarditis in patients with an abnormal mitral valve and moderate to severe MR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-and-microbiology-of-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, and microbiology of infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In chronic primary MR, the arterial pulse is normal until very late in disease progression because LV ejection time and forward stroke volume remain normal. With acute MR or with end-stage chronic severe MR, there is a rapid reduction in the volume of forward flow late in systole along with a decrease in ejection time, so that the arterial pulse falls off rapidly, which may give the impression of a bounding pulse, similar to that seen with aortic regurgitation. However, the pulse pressure is normal with MR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Enlargement of the LV results in a leftward displacement of the apical impulse; it is usually brisk or hyperdynamic. When the MR is severe or when there has been an acute exacerbation of the regurgitation as a result of chordal rupture, an S3 and a palpable thrill may be present. Crackles (rales) may be detected but are absent in many patients with symptomatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Signs of right-sided congestive heart failure are typically absent unless there is associated mitral stenosis or the MR is of long standing and is very severe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-precordial-pulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the precordial pulsation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Physical examination cannot reliably distinguish chronic severe MR due to primary valve disease from secondary MR due to ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy.

In most cases, the murmur is holosystolic, commencing immediately after S1 and continuing up to (and sometime beyond) and obscuring A2, a result of the persistent pressure gradient between the left ventricle and atrium after aortic valve closure.</p><p>The murmur is heard best over the apex. When the MR jet is directed posterolaterally, the murmur radiates to the axilla and when very loud, may radiate to the posterior left thorax. The murmur radiates toward the base and the neck if the MR jet is directed anteromedially. It is most often blowing and high pitched in quality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is some correlation between the MR murmur grade and regurgitant severity with primary mitral valve disease. A loud murmur associated with a thrill (grade 4 or greater) has a specificity of 91 percent for severe MR, but a sensitivity of only 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Conversely, severe MR is rarely present with a grade 1 to 2 murmur. However, there is a wide range of MR severity with a grade 3 murmur (which is common) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The loudness of the murmur correlates even less well with severity in secondary (functional) MR. Up to half of patients with chronic ischemic MR lack an audible murmur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>In addition to the classic holosystolic murmur, other types of murmurs can be heard in chronic MR:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the posterior leaflet is predominantly involved (due to prolapse or chordal rupture), the murmur may radiate anteriorly toward the sternum and is heard well at the base. This type of murmur is often confused with aortic stenosis but does not radiate to the carotid arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the anterior leaflet is predominantly involved (due to prolapse or chordal rupture), the murmur is often loud, radiates to the back, and may be heard on the top of the head as a result of the excellent sound transmission along the vertebral column.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mid to late systolic murmur, harsh in quality, is often heard when the MR is due to prolapse or papillary muscle displacement (previously known as papillary muscle dysfunction). When the murmur is confined to late systole, the volumetric severity of MR is usually only mild to moderate, even if the murmur is loud. S1 is intact in this setting, since the initial closure of the mitral leaflets is normal. The murmur of papillary muscle displacement is variable and becomes louder and longer when there is an acute ischemic episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infrequently, the large diastolic volume across the mitral valve with severe MR produces an early diastolic murmur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56783\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56783 \">movie 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the cause is mitral valve prolapse, a midsystolic click (correlating with the maximal prolapse and tension on the chordae) may be heard and the murmur may start in mid to late systole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57858\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef57858 \">movie 2</a>).

The use of certain maneuvers may be helpful in this regard. However, interpretation of changes in a murmur with maneuvers is often difficult and may not be reproducible. The most accurate and cost-effective method for determining the cause of a systolic murmur is echocardiography.

However, LV size does not correlate with the severity of MR, nor does left atrial size correlate with the elevation of left atrial pressure.</p><p>LV enlargement causes the cardiac silhouette to be displaced towards the left chest wall and the chamber becomes globular. Enlargement of the left atrium results in a straightening of the left heart border with the appearance of a double density and elevation of the left main stem bronchus.</p><p>The right ventricle is usually normal in size unless there is pulmonary hypertension.

The electrocardiogram in chronic MR most often reflects the hemodynamic burden placed on the left atrium, which can lead to left atrial enlargement, similar to that seen in mitral stenosis. The P wave broadens (&gt;0.12 sec in lead II), becomes increased in amplitude, has notching, and has a significant negative component in V1 (called &quot;P-mitrale&quot;).

Most patients with MR are asymptomatic since symptoms are a late manifestation of disease. Testing to establish a diagnosis of MR also involves evaluating the severity of MR, identifying its cause, and determining its hemodynamic consequences (ie, impact on left atrial size, left ventricular [LV] size and function, and pulmonary artery pressure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95916%7ECARD%2F95917\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95916 graphicRef95917 \">table 3A-B</a>). </p><p>The diagnosis in patients with suspected MR is generally confirmed by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). TTE is recommended in patients with known or suspected MR to determine the severity, etiology, and hemodynamic consequences of MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/24,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29-31</a>]. Left atrial size is usually increased. LV size and systolic function are normal early in the disease course, but progressive ventricular dilation and a decline in ejection fraction occur with chronic severe MR. Pulmonary artery pressures also can be noninvasively estimated using Doppler echocardiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the mitral valve&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the TTE is technically suboptimal, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is recommended. One study of 248 patients found that, when compared with surgical diagnosis, the accuracy of TEE was high: 99 percent for etiology and mechanism, presence of vegetations, and prolapsed or flail segment, and 88 percent for ruptured chordae; diagnostic accuracy was higher for TEE compared with TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Three-dimensional TTE and TEE may be particularly helpful.

MR can also be identified and quantified by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) or by cardiac catheterization. The severity of MR is most commonly determined using semi-quantitative echocardiographic parameters. </p><p>When qualitative measures suggest more than mild MR is present, quantitation with calculation of regurgitant volume and regurgitant orifice area is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Doppler and color flow Doppler can be used to measure the severity of MR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63107%7ECARD%2F75955\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef63107 graphicRef75955 \">movie 3A-B</a>). The simplest approach is measurement of the narrowest segment of the jet, or vena contracta, on color flow imaging. Mitral regurgitant severity can be measured more precisely, when clinically indicated, by calculation of the regurgitant volume, regurgitant fraction, and effective regurgitant orifice area using Doppler approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

Another key issue is that ERO does not account for the duration of regurgitation (mid-late systolic versus holosystolic), which likely explains why regurgitant volume rather than ERO predicted outcomes in one large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Eccentric MR jets are also more difficult to assess using echocardiographic measures. These issues are discussed in more detail separately.

The dynamic nature of MR explains variations in the degree of MR with general anesthesia and in some patients presenting with acute pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>If the severity of MR cannot be adequately assessed by echocardiography, quantitation of regurgitant volume can be performed by CMR. Quantitation of regurgitant volume can also be performed at cardiac catheterization, though due to technical limitations, semi-quantitative angiographic grading of regurgitation is generally performed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H685178974\"><span class=\"h3\">Identifying the cause of MR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of the cause and type (primary or secondary) of MR is required for appropriate management of MR as well as any associated conditions. The clinical presentation and imaging are helpful in establishing a cause. If the cause of MR cannot be identified by TTE, the cause can generally be determined by TEE. Three-dimensional echocardiography may be beneficial for defining valve morphology. Careful evaluation of the mechanism of MR is required, since patients with primary MR are managed differently from those with secondary MR. As an example, while secondary ischemic MR is common among patients with coronary heart disease and prior myocardial infarction, some patients with primary MR due to degenerative disease have coexisting coronary heart disease.</p><p>Primary MR is diagnosed when imaging demonstrates abnormal mitral valve leaflets or chordae. With mitral valve prolapse, the leaflets are diffusely thickened and redundant, with systolic displacement of some leaflet segments into the left atrium in systole, most often the central scallop of the posterior leaflet (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse#H28357003\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>). Rheumatic disease causes typically thickening at the leaflet tips with chordal shortening, thickening and fusion, often with hemodynamics showing combined regurgitation and stenosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease#H23709418\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease&quot;, section on 'Chronic valve disease'</a>). Infective endocarditis causes MR due to leaflet destruction and the presence of a valve vegetation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-echocardiography-in-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of echocardiography in infective endocarditis&quot;</a>). Congenital mitral valve disease often is accompanied by other congenital abnormalities; for example, a cleft anterior mitral leaflet often is associated with a primum atrial septal defect or an atrioventricular canal defect.

Papillary muscle rupture may be caused by acute myocardial infarction or trauma. When a chordal or papillary muscle rupture is present, the movement of the leaflets is markedly exaggerated and the ruptured chord or papillary muscle is seen in the left atrium in systole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64363%7ECARD%2F60709%7ECARD%2F61846\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64363 graphicRef60709 graphicRef61846 \">movie 4A-C</a>).

Causes include coronary heart disease (which causes &quot;ischemic MR&quot;) and cardiomyopathies (eg, dilated or hypertrophic). Ischemic MR is characterized by apical &quot;tenting&quot; or &quot;tethering&quot; of the leaflets, resulting in inadequate apposition of the leaflets, which often do not reach the level of the mitral annulus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52748%7ECARD%2F73594%7ECARD%2F54431\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef52748 graphicRef73594 graphicRef54431 \">movie 5A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

Tricuspid regurgitation causes a holosystolic murmur that is located at the left lower sternal border and increases with inspiration. A ventricular septal defect causes a harsh holosystolic murmur (often with a thrill) at the left sternal border; however, with elevated pulmonary artery pressures, the murmur becomes shorter. </p><p>A careful physical exam is helpful in distinguishing the above murmurs. A transthoracic echocardiogram is diagnostic for each of these lesions. In an echocardiogram, care should be taken to distinguish the spectral signal from aortic outflow from that of MR. Distinguishing characteristics of MR signal include holosystolic duration and presence of mitral inflow signal during diastole.

The goals of monitoring are to assess changes in clinical status by history and physical examination and to assess (generally by transthoracic echocardiography) changes in severity of MR, left atrial size, left ventricular cavity size, systolic function, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure that can occur in the absence of symptoms.</p><p>The recommendations for serial monitoring, which vary with the severity of MR, are presented separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1671064963\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes of secondary (functional) MR include coronary heart disease and cardiomyopathies (eg, dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Ischemic MR primarily occurs in patients with a prior myocardial infarction. The MR may become more severe with adverse ventricular remodeling and may acutely worsen with ischemia or changes in hemodynamic conditions. (See <a href=\"#H1671064963\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with severe MR are initially asymptomatic. When symptoms develop, they include exertional dyspnea and fatigue. Another common clinical presentation is paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with chronic MR, the arterial pulse is usually brisk and the apical impulse is usually hyperdynamic. The murmur of MR is usually holosystolic and blowing in quality. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography is essential for diagnosing MR and establishing its severity, etiology, and hemodynamic consequences. (See <a href=\"#H10151024\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiographic criteria for severe MR include vena contracta width &ge;0.7 cm, regurgitant fraction &ge;50 percent, and regurgitant jet area &gt;40 percent of left atrial area or a holosystolic eccentric jet. Additional criteria for severe MR include effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) area &ge;0.40 cm<sup>2 </sup>and regurgitant volume &ge;60 mL. (See <a href=\"#H101647585\" class=\"local\">'Identifying the severity of MR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cause of MR cannot be identified by transthoracic echocardiography, the cause can generally be determined by transesophageal echocardiography. Three-dimensional echocardiography may be particularly beneficial for defining valve morphology. (See <a href=\"#H685178974\" class=\"local\">'Identifying the cause of MR'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is not recommended for routine diagnosis of MR. When echocardiographic measures of MR severity or left ventricular function are inadequate, or when there is a discrepancy between clinical findings and echocardiography, CMR assessment of MR severity may be helpful, especially in situations in which the echocardiographic findings and patient symptoms are discordant. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major indications for cardiac catheterization in a patient with MR are to assess hemodynamics and severity of MR when noninvasive tests are inconclusive or discordant and for definition of coronary anatomy when patients are being considered for an intervention. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac catheterization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommendations for serial transthoracic echocardiographic monitoring, which vary with the severity of MR, are presented separately.
