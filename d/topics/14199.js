Most series of older patients with newly diagnosed AML have noted complete remission (CR) rates between 40 and 60 percent, with higher rates seen in more recent trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults/abstract/2-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-14</a>]. While suitably selected older patients given intensive induction therapy may achieve CR at a rate approximating that of younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], others may spend a significant proportion of their remaining life in a hospital setting receiving treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Registry data indicate that the median age for patients with AML is approximately 68 years, which is more than a decade older than the median age of patients commonly reported on clinical trials. Unfortunately, many older adults receive no therapy for this disease. An analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data (2000 to 2007) linked to Medicare showed that less than half of newly diagnosed patients &ge;65 years of age received any leukemia-directed therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Older age, variously defined in most studies as over age 55, 60, or 65, is a poor prognostic factor in AML. In comparison with younger patients, AML in older patients is generally more challenging to treat, as evidenced by the following characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower percentage of favorable cytogenetics</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher percentage of unfavorable cytogenetics </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher incidence of multidrug resistance</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher incidence of treatment-resistant disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower CR rates, shorter remission durations, and shorter median overall survival</p><p/><p>Older adults are also more likely to have comorbidities and a poorer performance status that increase treatment-related morbidity and mortality, and limit intensive treatments such as allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Although age is one of the most important predictors of treatment-related mortality (TRM, eg, 30-day mortality), it is likely not an independent variable and largely acts as an indirect measure of other prognostic factors. This was best shown in an analysis of 3365 adults with newly diagnosed AML that created a scoring system to estimate TRM based upon age, sex, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> performance status, laboratory features, and the presence or absence of secondary AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The ability of the scoring system to predict TRM was similar whether or not age was incorporated; as such, older age by itself is not a contraindication to treatment.</p><p>An analysis of Medicare claims for 2657 older patients with AML diagnosed between 1991 and 1996 underscored the grim prognosis for AML in the older patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median survival for all patients was two months, with a two-year overall survival of 6 percent.

In this cohort approximately 40 percent of patients received anti-leukemia therapy, with a median survival of two months in untreated patients versus six months in those who received any therapy. The largest improvements were seen in those aged 65 to 69 (median survival 10 months, if treated).</p><p>Outcomes might be better if more patients were offered induction chemotherapy. A retrospective analysis of 2767 patients with AML (excluding those with acute promyelocytic leukemia) from the Swedish acute leukemia registry reported that early death rates (ie, death within 30 days of diagnosis) were considerably lower in patients receiving intensive induction chemotherapy when compared with those who received palliative therapy, even when stratified for performance status; it remains possible, however, that patients with a better prognosis were more likely to be offered induction chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>]. The difference between 30-day mortality rates for the two groups ranged from 16 to 35 percent. Patients who had de novo AML, were &quot;fit&quot; for intensive chemotherapy, had an ECOG performance status of zero to 2, and were age 16 to 55, 56 to 65, 66 to 75, and 76 to 89 had median overall survival times of 7 years, 18 months, 14 months, and 6 months, respectively.</p><p>In addition, a study of 103 newly diagnosed patients with AML who received intensive chemotherapy suggested that the impact of treatment on quality of life and physical function (both self-reported and objectively measured) was similar between younger (range 21 to 59 years) and older (60 to 80 years) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6273191\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3543768763\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of risk factors have been identified that occur more frequently in the older patient with AML and appear to contribute to the worse outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60295\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60295 \">table 1</a>).

In one study, older adults without mutations in genes recurrently mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome (<em>SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, ZRSR2, ASXL1, EZH2, BCOR, </em>or<em> STAG2</em>) had response rates similar to those of younger de novo AML when treated with standard AML therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

This tool was devised using data from 1406 older adults with AML who were otherwise healthy and were treated with two courses of intensive induction chemotherapy in the context of a clinical trial.

Cross study comparisons can be difficult due to differences in treatment and patient selection.

Multi-site studies are on-going to determine whether brief cognitive screening can identify older adults at risk for poor treatment tolerance.
