The rates for morbidity and mortality depend on many factors (eg, patient comorbidities, operative approach, <span class=\"nowrap\">hospital/surgeon</span> volume) but vary widely between publications. A review of all publications between 2005 and 2009 found that no single complication was reported in all papers, and in-hospital mortality, the most common term for postoperative death, had six different definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The systemic and procedure-specific complications of esophageal resection are reviewed here. Methods by which surgical resection is accomplished are reviewed separately.

Pulmonary complications are the most common postoperative complications, occurring in 16 to 67 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/7,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14-16</a>], but anastomotic leak is the most dreaded, occurring in 0 to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/7,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H551084598\" class=\"local\">'Anastomotic leak'</a> below and <a href=\"#H89118810\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary'</a> below.) </p><p>A multivariate analysis identified several preoperative factors that increased the risk of complications following esophageal resection and reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some of these included increasing age, conditions associated with compromised pulmonary function (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), malnutrition, renal or hepatic dysfunction, and emergency surgery. The preoperative indication for surgery (ie, malignant or benign disease) was not associated with increased morbidity. Patients with malignant disease had similar 30-day morbidity rates compared with patients with benign disease (49.0 versus 51.1 percent). </p><p>Comorbid illnesses increase the risk of postoperative complications (eg, cardiorespiratory complications, anastomotic leakage, reoperation rates, wound infection) and death following esophagectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/8,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19,20</a>]. As an example, in a prospective study of 615 patients, those with comorbid illness had an increased overall rate of postoperative complications or major anastomotic leaks compared with patients without comorbidities (28 versus 18 percent and 11 versus &lt;1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, a metaregression from a separate study showed the risk of anastomotic leakage or atrial fibrillation in obese patients with diabetes was significantly higher compared with obese patients without diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Age may be a surrogate for comorbid illness. Appropriately selected elderly patients can undergo esophagectomy with comparable outcomes to younger patients. Prospective and retrospective studies using multivariable logistic regression analysis found that increasing age is independently associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/3,8,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,20,21</a>]. However, in a prospective analysis of 615 patients undergoing an esophagectomy, patients older than 75 years of age had a similar rate of complications compared with those 75 years and younger (29 of 110 patients [26 percent] versus 125 of 505 patients [25 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The rate of a major anastomotic complication was also similar (12 patients [11 percent] versus 44 patients [9 percent]). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551083737\"><span class=\"h1\">MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall in-hospital mortality rates range from 0 to 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/2,3,7,22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,7,22-27</a>]. The overall 30-day mortality rates (excluding in-hospital deaths) is &lt;1 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Postoperative pulmonary complications are the most significant factor contributing to death following esophageal resection and reconstruction. In a retrospective review of 379 patients, the incidence of death for patients who developed pneumonia was significantly higher compared with those who did not (20 versus 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Increasing age was the only other variable independently associated with postoperative mortality. Anastomotic complications were once associated with a 50 percent mortality rate, but with aggressive management, including immediate reoperation for uncontained leaks, or in some cases stent placement, mortality resulting from leak has declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H89118810\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary'</a> below and <a href=\"#H551084598\" class=\"local\">'Anastomotic leak'</a> below.)</p><p>Other clinical factors that increase the risk of perioperative (30-day) death following esophageal resection and reconstruction included ascites, increasing age, insulin-dependent diabetes, decreased functional status, neoadjuvant therapy, renal dysfunction, excess alcohol use, and hepatic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Mortality rates were similar for patients who underwent resection for cancer versus benign disease (9.7 versus 10.1 percent). In a separate retrospective review of 23 studies that included 13 randomized trials, neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy did <strong>not</strong> increase the risk of postoperative complications or 30-day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>The development of postoperative surgical complications significantly affects longer-term mortality rates. In a prospective study of 615 patients who underwent an esophagectomy, the median survival was significantly shorter in patients who sustained surgical complications compared with those without complications (15 versus 22 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Including only those who survived 90 days or longer postoperatively (n = 567), the risk of mortality was significantly increased in patients who sustained postoperative complications (hazard ratio [HR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.63). Most patients who die following an esophagectomy have experienced multiple serious complications (median 2.5, range 1 to 8) rather than a single event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H355806644\" class=\"local\">'Procedure-specific complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who undergo esophagectomy at hospitals where a larger number of esophagectomies are performed have lower perioperative mortality rates and better early clinical outcomes compared with lower-volume institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/9,22,23,30-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22,23,30-37</a>]. The definition of low versus high volume is variable, with most studies defining &quot;low volume&quot; as &lt;4 to &lt;10 procedures and &quot;high volume&quot; as &gt;9 to &gt;40 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Surgeon experience, dedicated intensive care teams, nursing skill, respiratory therapy, resource allocation, multidisciplinary team management, and availability of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic equipment are examples of variables that are likely enhanced at high-volume centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. As an example, in one report that used Medicare claims data, the mortality following esophagectomy at the highest-volume hospitals (&gt;19 procedures annually) was significantly lower compared with the lowest-volume hospitals (&lt;2 procedures annually, adjusted odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.26-0.50) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a later review of nine trials, in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were significantly lower at high-volume hospitals (2.8 versus 8.5 percent and 0.7 versus 2.0 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355805904\"><span class=\"h1\">SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89118810\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary complications are the most frequent complications following esophageal resection and reconstruction, occurring in approximately 16 to 67 percent of all patients, and account for approximately two-thirds of mortality related to esophageal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/3,7,14,15,21,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,14,15,21,43</a>]. Pneumonia is an independent risk factor for postoperative mortality. (See <a href=\"#H551083737\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p>Postoperative pulmonary complications include pneumonia, bronchospasm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary embolism. The risk of venous thromboembolism is approximately 1.5 to 2.4 percent following an esophagectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>]. The management of postoperative pulmonary complications is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-postoperative-pulmonary-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of postoperative pulmonary complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative measures that can reduce postoperative pulmonary complications include preoperative respiratory rehabilitation (eg, smoking cessation, inspiratory muscle training), postoperative lung expansion maneuvers, proper perioperative oral hygiene, postoperative pulmonary toilet, and adequate pain management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-to-reduce-postoperative-pulmonary-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initial attempts at oral intake following esophagectomy should be supervised, and liberal use of speech therapy services is encouraged in order to avoid aspiration events, especially in patients with a neck incision where the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury is elevated. (See <a href=\"#H551085660\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury'</a> below.)</p><p>The operative approach itself may influence the risk of respiratory complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. As an example, in a trial that randomly assigned patients with adenocarcinoma involving the mid-to-distal esophagus to a transthoracic or transhiatal approach (cervical phase identical), those undergoing a transthoracic esophagectomy were significantly more likely to experience pulmonary complications (57 versus 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In another trial that compared open versus minimally invasive esophagectomy following adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients undergoing open transthoracic esophagectomy had a significantly higher rate of pulmonary complications (29 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. There were no significant differences in the numbers of patients in each group with respect to stage of disease. In a review of 1568 patients undergoing elective esophagectomy from the National Surgery Quality Improvement (NSQIP) database, thoracic approaches to esophagectomy increased the risk of pneumonia, ventilator dependence, and septic shock but not mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A description of the esophagectomy procedures is provided in a separate topic.

In a retrospective review of 324 esophagectomy patients, the incidence of atrial fibrillation for patients undergoing a transthoracic esophagectomy, transhiatal esophagectomy, and three-field esophagectomy were 16.2, 18.6, and 16.7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

A retrospective review of 921 patients undergoing esophagectomy found that patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation had significantly higher rates of pulmonary complications, anastomotic leaks, and mortality rates compared with patients without atrial fibrillation (42 versus 17 percent, 6.9 versus 1.4 percent, and 23 versus 6 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. While difficult to prove, it is entirely possible that atrial fibrillation is an indicator of other complications (ie, a first warning <span class=\"nowrap\">sign/consequence),</span> rather than the cause of the problem. Patients undergoing major thoracic operations (including esophagectomy) with postoperative atrial fibrillation also had a significantly higher mortality rate and longer hospital mean length of stay compared with those patients without atrial fibrillation (7.5 versus 2.0 percent, and [mean &plusmn; standard deviation] 8.2&plusmn;11.0 versus 16.6&plusmn;18.6 days, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>Management of atrial fibrillation is discussed as a separate topic.

The reported rates of myocardial infarction are similar to those of other thoracic surgical operations, and there are no procedure-specific contributors to this incidence. However, the occurrence of myocardial infarction has significant implications for the health of the conduit, and options for management of perioperative myocardial infarction following esophagectomy may be more limited (limited anticoagulation, no thrombolysis). Management of a postoperative myocardial infarction is typically done in consultation with a cardiologist and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-myocardial-infarction-or-injury-after-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative myocardial infarction or injury after noncardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355806644\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE-SPECIFIC COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The more common complications related to the esophagectomy procedure include conduit complications (eg, anastomotic leak, ischemia, stricture), nerve injury, lymphatic leak, functional disorders, and diaphragmatic hernia, which are discussed below. Other rarer complications include airway injury, tracheoesophageal injury, and splenic injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H52718651\"><span class=\"h2\">Conduit complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ischemia and denervation of the conduit are the inherent complications of creating a neoesophagus. In one study, scanning laser Doppler perfusion measurements were significantly decreased in each of 16 patients after stomach mobilization and gastric tube formation, compared with measurements taken beforehand. The decrease (by approximately 70 percent) was particularly prominent at the proximal end of the gastric conduit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Reduced conduit perfusion can lead to anastomotic breakdown and leak <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stricture formation, or to functional conduit disorders. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551084598\"><span class=\"h3\">Anastomotic leak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of anastomotic leak ranges from 5 to 40 percent following esophageal resection and anastomosis, and the mortality associated with leak is between 2 and 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/7,17,18,28,51-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,18,28,51-59</a>]. Perianastomotic leaks may also occur due to gastric staple line failure or gastric tip necrosis, which can be differentiated with endoscopic and radiographic studies. Factors that influence the incidence of anastomotic leak include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anastomotic technique (hand sewn versus stapled versus hybrid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of the anastomosis (neck versus chest)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of conduit (stomach versus colon versus small bowel)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of the conduit (orthotopic versus heterotopic)</p><p/><p>In a single-center retrospective review of 393 esophagectomy patients, risk factors for development of an anastomotic leak include conduit ischemia (odds ratio [OR] 5.5, 95% CI 2.5-12.2), neoadjuvant therapy (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.5), and comorbid conditions (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A review of the Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) database that included 7595 esophagectomies identified heart failure, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and type of procedure as significant factors associated with anastomotic leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p>A thoracic anastomosis, due to a shorter conduit length and less tension with resultant improved proximal conduit perfusion, is less prone to leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/7,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,59</a>]. In the STS study, the leak rate was 9.3 percent in patients with intrathoracic anastomosis and 12.3 percent for those who had a cervical anastomosis. In a prior systematic review, the odds ratio of developing an anastomotic leak for those undergoing a cervical anastomosis relative to a thoracic anastomosis was 3.43 (95% CI 1.09-10.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. No difference in mortality was identified when comparing cervical with thoracic leaks. However, the morbidity of pleural and mediastinal soilage is theoretically higher than for cervical leaks, which are generally contained by the neck anatomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551085095\"><span class=\"h4\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, cervical anastomotic leaks can be managed with drainage of the neck wound with subsequent wet-to-dry dressing changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Thoracic anastomotic leaks are more likely to require re-exploration for appropriate control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], although endoscopic stenting or transluminal vacuum therapy may provide acceptable outcomes in selected circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. As an example, 49 patients were treated endoscopically for esophageal anastomotic leaks after cancer surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Thirty-one patients had a covered stent placed across the leaks; three patients had the leaks closed with clips. After a median follow-up of 83 days, 88 percent of patients achieved healing of their leaks. Of the 23 patients who received more than one endoscopic intervention, 96 percent healed their leaks. However, stent migration remains a challenge, especially in the thoracic anastomotic position. Furthermore, there remains concern that the radial forces exerted by expandable stents could worsen regional ischemia and thus cause more significant tissue loss. Finally, stent erosion into surrounding structures such as the aorta and airway remains a risk with prolonged use of this technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>Other basic principles of anastomotic leak management include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood flow to the esophageal conduit is vulnerable to hypotension.

This can vary from minor anastomotic breakdown to, rarely, complete loss of the conduit. In a retrospective review of 393 consecutive esophagectomy patients, the presence of comorbid illness increased the risk of conduit ischemia twofold (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.3), and patients with conduit ischemia had a higher 30-day mortality rate compared with those without ischemia (13.9 versus 3.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

For gastric conduit ischemia, a gastrostomy tube may be left in place if there is reasonable-appearing distal stomach. If not, total gastrectomy is warranted. Important additional components of this operation include adequate drainage of all infected spaces, aggressive resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage (similar to that for anastomotic leak), and closure of the hiatal defect to prevent later herniation.

Stricture can be due to conduit ischemia or, with later presentation, recurrent disease at the anastomosis. Anastomotic strictures can cause symptoms of dysphagia, odynophagia, and aspiration and can lead to inadequate dietary intake and malnutrition. Patients with symptoms suggestive of postoperative stricture should undergo endoscopy. </p><p>Anastomotic stricture is often closely linked to conduit <span class=\"nowrap\">malperfusion/ischemia</span> or surgical technique. In a retrospective review of 393 consecutive esophagectomies, the incidence of stricture was higher in patients with an ischemic conduit versus those that were not ischemic (48 versus 5 percent). Patients who had an anastomotic leak were also significantly more likely to develop an anastomotic stricture compared with patients without a leak (47 versus 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, of the 80 patients who developed a stricture, 65 percent had no evidence of an anastomotic leak or conduit ischemia.

Comparison of anastomotic techniques would suggest that the modified Collard or hybrid staple technique has a lower incidence of anastomotic stricture compared with hand-sewn or circular stapler techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/51-53,60,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53,60,69</a>]. </p><p>Benign strictures can be effectively managed by endoscopic dilatation (ie, balloon or Savary dilators).

All patients experienced symptomatic improvement with subsequent endoscopic dilation, and 77 percent had sustainable relief of dysphagia following a median of two dilation sessions. </p><p>Surgical revision of the anastomosis is rarely indicated and may require resection and diversion. In the clinical setting of locally recurrent esophageal disease, surgical resection should be considered in patients who are able to tolerate an additional surgical procedure. For a recurrent lesion confined to a small area, a local resection and reanastomosis can be performed; however, a completion esophagogastrectomy and colonic or jejunal interposition is more often required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

However, a study raises concern about this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-esophageal-resection/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. This retrospective review of 1804 patients undergoing esophagectomy for treatment of esophageal cancer found that prophylactic ligation of the thoracic duct did not reduce the incidence of postoperative chyle leak but, on multivariate analysis, was associated with significantly worse long-term survival.

The indication for esophageal resection (malignant versus benign disease) has not been associated with increased morbidity. A thoracic anastomosis, due to a shorter conduit length and less anastomotic tension, thus improving proximal conduit perfusion, is less prone to leak compared with a cervical anastomosis.
